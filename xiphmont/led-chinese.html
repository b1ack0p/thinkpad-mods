  <em>Update 20150526 and Warning</em>: These modding pages are
  unmaintained; they're still here for historical reasons.  All of the
  LED kits I've tried from Chinese vendors have one drawback or
  another and I want the best possible conversion results.  Rather
  than coming up with more and more complicated modifications to fix
  the shortcomings of existing kits, I eventually decided it was much
  easier to design and make <a href="led-kit.html">my own driver
  boards that were designed specifically for Thinkpads</a>.

<p>Several vendors sell generic CCFL to LED backlight upgrade
  kits, and a few sell upgrade kits tailored to specific Thinkpad
  models.  The generic kits can be modded to work with a Thinkpad
  reasonably easily, and the specific kits can be modded to work
  better than they would otherwise.</p>

<p>A partial list of vendors that carry at least one of the kits
below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.xccfl.com"><b>xCCFL.com</b></a><br/> Generic
    and Thinkpad-specific kits. The Thinkpad-specific kits use
    the <a href="led-fancyboost.html">Fancyboost</a>, no idea what
    the generic laptop kits use (6/2014).
  </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.iccfl.com"><b>iCCFL.com</b></a><br/> Generic
    and Thinkpad-specific kits. The Thinkpad-specific
    kits used the <a href="led-fancyboost.html">Fancyboost</a>, and
    the generic laption kits the
    <a href="led-unboostyB.html">Unboosty-Blue</a>
    and <a href="led-cheapybuck.html">Cheapybuck</a> (9/2014).
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/creatall88"><b>CreatAll</b></a><br/>
  Generic LED conversion kits, laptop kits most recently using
  the <a href="led-unboosty.html">Unboosty</a> (6/2014).
  </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.lcd-chip.com/"><b>lcd-chip.com</b></a><br/>
  Generic LED conversion kits.  The laptop kits delivered used
  the <a href="led-simpleboost.html">Simpleboost</a>
  and <a href="led-cheapybuck.html">Cheapybuck</a> (7/2014).
  </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.ccfloffer.com/"><b>ccfloffer.com</b></a><br/>
  Generic LED conversion kits. They advertise what looks like an older
  variant of the <a href="led-cheapybuck.html">Cheapybuck</a>, but
  apparently actually ship
  the <a href="led-unboostyB.html">Unboosty-Blue</a> (9/2014).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As frustrating as it may be, the Chinese vendors switch up specific
  kits all the time. They usually consider the kits to be interchangeable
  and send whatever they have in stock that week, product description
  and photos be damned.  You don't know for sure what you're getting
  until you look at the driver board after the kit arrives.  Below are
  a few of the kits in the wild as of August 2014.</p>

<p>This driver is a simple boost convertor with constant-current
  output.  Some vendors sell it with an additional flat-ribbon
  connector, most sell it with the ribbon connector missing and
  those solder pads left bare as in the pic above.</p>

<p>The LEDs provided with the kit must be arranged in at least 10S
  strings for Thinkpads with internal 20V power (like the
  X60/61-series) else the LEDs will never go out completely even
  when the machine is 'off'. It seems these 12.1&quot;/255mm kits
  usually come with 60 LEDs in 10S/6P; that works fine.</p>

<p>This board requires modification to work with a Thinkpad. It can be
  trimmed and grafted onto existing inverter boards easily.</p>

<p>This is a much smaller boost controller than the Simpleboost
  kit with a nicer driver IC. I've only seen it pre-grafted onto
  inverter boards in specialized kits for specific laptop models,
  usually replacing the coils under the copper-colored EMI
  shield. In the pic above, it's been fitted to an X61T inverter
  board as part of an X60T/X61T kit from xccfl.com.</p>

<p>These model-specific kits can be dropped right into a Thinkpad
  without any modification or soldering.  The stock board is set up
  to use low-frequency PWM for a 6:1 brightness control range. With
  a simple mod (that does require some soldering) it can use
  high-frequency (24kHz) PWM instead, eliminating any hint of
  flicker but reducing the dimmable range slightly.  These kits are
  pricey: currently $35 to $45 plus DHL express shipping from China
  (another $20-$30).</p>

<p>At first I thought this was a slightly different version of the
  Simpleboost as it uses mostly the same components and the same boost
  controller IC.  Upon closer inspection, it's arranged as a low-side
  buck-down controller instead!  This is a weird/clever design that
  mostly ignores the IC's spec sheet, but works well.  The board can
  be set up to drive any 9.6V constant-current LED backlight
  strip.</p>

<p class=in style="color: #bb4400;">
  <em>Update and Warning</em>: Oh well, it <em>seemed</em> like it worked
  well enough.  I've since gotten boards that flicker noticably with
  the slightest shift in input voltage, eg with processor load,
  regardless of the mod used.  There's no correcting the problem no
  matter how fancy the mod--- it's a consequence of lobotomizing a
  boost controller to use it in buck mode.</p>

<p class=in style="color: #bb4400;">
  <em>Warning #2: As shipped, the boards I bought for evaluation were
      configured to put out far too much current for the
      12.1&quot;/255mm LED strips included.  Do not try to test this
      kit without reading the modding page, or you'll probably damage
      the LED strip!
  </em>
</p>

<p>This board requires modification to work with a Thinkpad. It is a
  little harder to graft onto existing inverters due to its size, but
  it can be done.</p>

<p>This appears to be another vendor's direct copy of the Unboosty kit
  above.  It's the same circuit on a different PCB using a smaller
  inductor and configured to put out lower current by default.</p>

<p>Like the Unboosty, this kit requires modification to work with a
  Thinkpad. It's a bit easier to render into a compact form.</p>

<p>This board is sold by multiple vendors in 'non-dimmable' LED
  kits. Those I've contacted are very very insistent there's
  no way this driver board can dim, and I'd need to buy a
  different [more expensive] kit to do so.</p>

<p>Pah! It dims perfectly well.  The datasheet is very clear on
  that point, as are actual test results.  Like with the other
  drivers, PWM mode allows a 6:1 dimming range.  The
  output is compatible with 9.6V constant-current LED strips.</p>

<p>This is the cheapest of the boards/kits, going for as little as
  $6+shipping, though that will come out to more after
  considering the parts needed for the Thinkpad-required
  modifications.  This is also the smallest of the driver boards
  and, fitted with a lower profile inductor, could possibly squeeze into
  places the other kits would not.</p>
