<p>ThinkPad LED Driver #1 (TLD1) is a buck-topology LED driver based
on the <a href="tps92510-2.pdf">Texas Instruments TPS92510</a>
controller IC.  It provides a single channel of dimmable
current-regulated output intended for 3S LED strings operating between
7V to 9.6V and a maximum design output current of 600mA (depending on
the components chosen) from an unregulated input of 10-24V.</p>

<h2 id=design>Design requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Input power supplied from an unregulated 10V-24V rail with substantial load noise</li>
<li>Output intended for single-channel '9.6V' LED strips with 3S16P-3S24P topology</li>
<li>Continuous-current (analog) dimming, not PWM</li>
<li>Dimmable range capability of &ge;25:1
<li>Regulation precision better than 1% at any brightness setting</li>
<li>Maximum dimensions of 46mm x 9.25mm x 4.4mm</li>
<li>Micropower draw when disabled</li>
</ul>


<p>The primary additional design criteria over existing driver boards
already available from Chinese vendors are a wide dimming range
(&ge;25:1), native Thinkpad signaling, and continuous-current
operation rather than dimming via PWM.</p>

<h2>Design detail</h2>

<p>TLD1 is based on the reference example circuits found in
the <a href="tps92510-2.pdf">Texas Instruments TPS92510</a> data
sheet.  The design makes three additions to the examples.</p>

<h3>Passive snubber</h3>
<p>A snubber resistor (R6) substantially reduces ground-state ringing
through coil L1 during discontinuous-mode operation.  Although the
circuit meets regulation precision without, R6 reduces regulation
error by more than half at low brightness (at the cost of about
three-quarters of a percent efficiency).</p>

<h3>Offset dimming</h3>
<p>The PWM dimming input (pin 4 of the TPS92510) is left unused, with
dimming implemented by offsetting the current sense voltage at pin 7.
C6 provides an AC-coupled current-sense waveform, with the DC
component offset by the voltage divider formed by R3 and R5.</p>

<h3>PWM to analog level conversion</h3>
<p>U3 charges C5 through RA and RB with each negative-phase of the
input PWM dimming control signal.  The voltage across C5 also presents
across the voltage divider (R3 and R5) to offset the current sense
signal at pin 7, dimming the output.  The voltage divider does double
duty, draining charge from C5 when the PWM waveform is high.  In this
way, U3, RA, RB, C5, R3 and R5 form a lowpass filter, converting a PWM
input signal to an analog voltage offset at pin 7.</p>

<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<h3>Precision/Accuracy</h3>

<p>The TPS92510 data sheet states that driver current accuracy is
+/-3%.  In reality, the accuracy error behaves more like a constant
current offset.  With trimming, regulation error is better than 1/4%
across the input and output operating range.</p>

<h3>Trimming</h3>

<p>Resistors RA and RB set the ratio of maximum brightness to minimum
brightness. The correct values depend on the brightness range of the
specific ThinkPad, the desired ratio, and the value of R3. The
inherent current offset of the particular driver IC will also affect
the minimum brightness by up to 5mA. See the bill of materials for
starting values.</p>

<p>Sense resistors RC and RD set the output current at full
brightness.  As per the data sheet, the effective resistance should be
200mV divided by the desired full-brightness output current.  Note
that the ratio set by RA and RB is not affected by the values of RC
and RD, aside from the hard limitation of the configuration's minimum
possible brightness. </p>

<h3>Static Sensitivity</h3>
<p>The TPS92510 is one of the most static-sensitive ICs I've worked with.
It is <em>exceptionally</em> easy to damage the internal sense amplifiers
when handling the chip.<p>

<p>Static damage usually manifests subtly as a higher-than expected
minimum brightness, or brightness steps on the minimum of the
scale proving metastable.  The circuit still works, it just 'acts
funny'.<p>

<p>Assembled circuits appear to be more normally robust against
static, likely due to large external capacitances protecting the
relevant sense inputs.  As yet, I've not had an assembled board suffer
static damage.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>TLD1 was originally the first prototype design for a
LED backlight conversion board for CCFL-equipped ThinkPads. 50
hand-soldered boards from the prototype run became the first
generation of X61 LED kits (Original and Daylight). With the
introduction of TLD3, remaining TLD1 boards will be used in
'Original' (335mA) X61 kits until the stock is depleted.</p>
