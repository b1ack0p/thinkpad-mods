<p>Whatever the LCD panel or LED kit, installing an LED backlight
strip into a CCFL-equipped panel follows the same sequence of steps.  The instructions below are long and exhaustive, but don't be discouraged; they're just over-detailed for the first-time modder.  The high level process is actually pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the lid, remove the inverter and LCD panel</li>
<li>Test the new LED backlight (before taking anything else apart!)</li>
<li>Clean and prep the LCD panel</li>
<li>Remove the old CCFL tube from LCD panel</li>
<li>Insert and shim the new LED strip</li>
<li>Plug in and mount the new LED driver</li>
<li>Put everything back together</li>
</ol>

</a>
Opening the lid, Removing the LCD panel</h2>

<p>It should go without saying, but remove AC power and the battery
before opening the machine.  Be aware that the backlight inverter is
always powered when the machine itself has powered, even when the
machine is turned off.</p>

<p>The official Hardware Maintenance Manuals describe and
illustrate the lid disassembly process in detail:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="42x3550_04.pdf">
      Hardware Maintenance Manual (HMM) for X60, X60s, X61 and X61s
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="42x3551_02.pdf">
      Hardware Maintenance Manual (HMM) for X60 Tablet and X61 Tablet
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it's not strictly necessary to remove the entire lid and
hinges from the rest of the laptop, though the HMM recommends
this.</p>

<p>The screen bezel is held in place both with screws and small
plastic latches along all four sides of the screen; some of the
latches pop apart upwards, but most pop apart <em>sideways</em>, often
alternating inward and outward.  There's some trick to getting them to
pop free; a beginner should mostly be aware they come apart fairly
easily when pulling/torquing in the right direction.  If the plastic is in
danger of bending or cracking, that's pulling too hard; back off and
try a different direction.</p>

<p>Also, most ThinkPad models have a strip of strong adhesive tape
along the bottom edge of the screen bezel, holding the bezel to the
bottom of the screen.  It will peel free with slow, steady pressure
and (although the hardware manual says otherwise), it can be reused a
few times.  If it's badly damaged or destroyed during disassembly,
Killer's 'Red' adhesive transfer tape is a good replacement (really,
Killer Red is a staple of laptop modding; if you don't have any, get
some and you'll wonder how you lived without it).</p>

<p>As per the HMM, unplug the LCD screen from both the inverter board
and LVDS cable and set it aside for now.  Also unplug and remove
CCFL inverter board.</p>

<h2>Test the new LED backlight now-- No seriously, do it!</h2>

<p>Testing the backlight now ensures it arrived in working condition,
which can narrow down the troubleshooting possibilities if a problem
occurs later during installation.<p>

<p>Plug the LED strip into the LED driver board, and the LED driver
board into the LVDS cable.  Remove the hard drive, then power the
machine on.  The laptop will happily boot to the splash screen without
an LCD plugged in, not that you can see it.</p>

<p>Within a count of 10, the LED backlight should fire.  In this
state, the screen brightness controls should work across their full
range.  If the backlight does not come on, or the brightness controls
do not work as expected, promptly shut the machine off and look for
connection problems*.  Do not leave the machine powered if there is any
problem with operation of the backlight.</p>

<p>When working normally, the driver will get warm to the touch,
especially at full brightness.  The LED strip can get quite hot-- this
is normal.  Once it's mounted in the panel, it will be able to
dissipate heat more efficiently into the metal backlight bracket than
it can into free air.</p>

<p>*<em>Note: If an LED driver board that is trimmed for a specific
ThinkPad model is plugged into a different model, it's expected that
the brightness range may not be entirely correct. There is no danger
to continuing to operate the LED backlight.</em></p>

<h2>Panel prep background</h2>

<p>Now that we know for sure the LED backlight works properly, we
can prep for installation.</p>

<h4>Cleaning</h4>
<p>Clean any crud or debris away from the seams between the LCD's
outer metal frame and the rest of the panel assembly.  On non-tablet
screens, pay special attention to the edges around the front of the
panel.  Any hard grit that makes its way into the panel will
eventually cause the dreaded 'white spots': fuzzy bright points in the
panel caused by scratches on the internal acrylic waveguide that's
responsible for evenly distributing the backlight illumination.
(Tablets are less prone to these spots as the front surface of the
panel is sealed.)</p>

<h4>Un-grounding the backlight bracket</h4>

<p>The backlight reflector bracket (that houses the CCFL) is normally
grounded to prevent stray electric fields from disturbing the CCFL's
arc, and to contain any electrical noise generated by the
backlight.</p>

<p>Neither is relevant to LEDs, and a grounded bracket poses a
short-circuit risk to the LED strip.  The inner surface of the bracket
is electrically insulated by a plastic film, but the metal edges of the
bracket are exposed.  LED current flow shorted to ground is not
limited/regulated by the LED controller and will blow a fuse either on
the inverter (there's only one, near the connector) or on the
motherboard itself (fuse F2 on the top of the motherboard near the
processor support bracket).<p>

<p>When the bracket is not grounded, the LED strip can only short to
itself, which is relatively harmless due to current limiting.</p>

<p>The ungrounding process is covered below, along with disassembly.</p>

<h4>Disassembly</h4>
<p>Removing the CCFL tube does not require complete panel disassembly,
but it does require popping the panel frame slightly open.  The LCD
panels used in Thinkpads (and most laptops) are held together by a
combination of screws, snap-fit hasps, and adhesive polyester tape.
Freeing the metal outer/front portion of the frame from the plastic
inner frame varies slightly by panel. Look for your panel from the
sections below.<p>
<ul>

  HV121P01-100/101, and similar)</a>

<hr class=skinny />

<p>The various BOE Hydis AFFS screen options have nearly identical
construction.  The prep process is the same regardless the specific
model number.</p>

<h4>Prepping the screen to remove the CCFL</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      If this screen is a finger-touch model (what Lenovo used to call
      'multitouch' before that term came to be used for
      multiple-finger touch sensing), disconnect the ribbon cable
      stretching from the front of the panel around the side to the
      Wacom digitizer on the back.  The ribbon is often secured to the
      connector with a dot of polyester tape that's hard to see, and
      to the Wacom backplane itself with a square of adhesive.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a class=left href="led-panel-touchscreen1.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-touchscreen1.jpg" /></a>
  <a class=right href="led-panel-touchscreen2.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-touchscreen2.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: This tablet screen is equipped with a pressure-sensitive
  front surface to detect finger contact as well as pen-input.  The
  touch sensitive front layer is connected to the Wacom controller via
  the ribbon cable (circled in red).  Finger-touch was
  available with both the older green-and-rust-colored Wacom
  backplanes as well as the later blue-and-silver version
  (pictured). Panels without the indicated ribbon cable accepted
  pen input only.</p>
</div>


<ol start=2>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the two machine screws fastening the LCD controller board
      to the frame.  <b>BE AWARE:</b> The flexible plastic cables
      attaching the controller board to the glass LCD are strong; the
      heat-bonded connections to the board and LCD glass are not.
      Flexing the cables is mostly safe, but never tug or peel the
      connection, or try to lift or move the panel by the controller
      board.  If any of those connections pulls free, it's Game Over:
      the LCD is dead. I don't yet know of any DIY fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>For what it's worth, I've damaged exactly one of these
      connections in a decade of disassembling LCD panels.  About nine
      years ago, I fumbled a panel while flipping it over and, without
      thinking, grabbed at the controller board rather than letting
      the panel drop onto the soft, cushioned work surface I'd set up
      to prevent exactly that kind of accident.</i>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      On models with a Wacom digitizer backplane that's a thin PCB
      (the rust/green colored version), also remove the two machine
      screws securing the backplane. The flexible silver/blue version
      of the backplane does not have these machine screws.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-panel-rust.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-rust.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: AFFS tablet screen equipped with the older rust-and-green
  Wacom backplane. This style of Wacom is secured to the screen frame
  with both tape and two machine screws (circled in blue), where the
  blue-and-silver version is only taped in place.  The machine screws
  holding the LCD panel controller to the frame are circled in
  red. This particular screen does not have the finger-touch
  option.</p>
</div>


<ol start=4>
  <li>
    <p>
      Carefully remove the Wacom digitizer backplane from the panel.
      Both versions are secured with double sided tape, one strip
      along the bottom near the backlight and/or strips up either side
      of the panel.  Pull gently and slowly; do not crease or break
      the white frame or exposed portions of the white plastic sheet
      inside the frame.  The Wacom backplane itself is fairly sturdy.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Replace (for now) the two machine screws fastening the LCD
      controller board to the frame.  We don't want the controller PCB
      flopping around during other work.  The screws will have to come
      back out again later to allow replacing the Wacom backplane during
      reassembly.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the thin white polyester tape that joins the metal frame
      to the white plastic frame, located along the bottom of the
      panel near the backlight.  Also remove the thin yellow tape
      underneath to expose the tiny machine screws on the far left and
      the far right side of the panel.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  circled in red.</p>
</div>

<h4>Breaking the backlight bracket ground connection</h4>

<p>The next few steps are optional to prevent any accidental short
circuits between the LED supply and a grounded backlight bracket.  A
short to ground will blow either the fuse on the inverter board
(there's only one), or fuse F2 on the top of the motherboard between the
LCD cable connector and the processor socket.</p>

<ol start=7>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the metal clips on the sides of the panel that cover the
      plastic mounting tabs and are secured to the white plastic frame
      with tiny screws.  After removing the clips, replace the screws
      to re-secure the underlying metal tabs extending from the
      backlight bracket.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  <p>Above: Remove the backlight grounding clips by first unscrewing
  the screw fastening them to the backlight bracket, then sliding them
  off the plastic mounting tab.</p>
</div>

<ol start=8>
  <li>
    <p>
      The metal clips removed in the previous step connect the
      backlight bracket to ground, but also function as reinforcements
      and thin spacers around the panel's plastic mounting tab.  We'll
      need to put them back during reassembly for everything to fit
      perfectly, but we don't want them to connect the backlight
      bracket to ground.  The solution: Cut the clip in half so that
      only the portion surrounding the white plastic mounting tab
      remains (see below).  Don't replace the clips now; we'll put
      them back onto the mounting tabs later during final reassembly
      after finishing the LED installation.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-panel-affs-clip3.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-affs-clip3.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: The two clips on either side of the panel that connect the
  backlight bracket to ground also function as spacers and
  reinforcements around the plastic mounting tabs.  We cut the
  connection to the backlight bracket off each clip, and will replace
  the clips back onto the mounting tabs later during final reassembly.</p>

<h4>Prepping the screen to remove the CCFL</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove any tape along the bottom of the panel
      that secures the metal front frame to the plastic inner frame,
      backlight bracket, and rear reflector.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Carefully remove (or just peel up the side of) the white
      protective tape along the right side of the panel.  This tape
      covers three short, flexible ribbon cable tabs extending from the side
      of the glass LCD layer. The connections between the ribbon and
      glass are fragile; do not pull on the exposed tabs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unscrew the two black machine screws on the sides of the screen
      near the bottom that attach the metal outer frame to the inner
      plastic frame.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a class=left href="led-panel-boetn-tape1.jpg">

  <a class=right href="led-panel-boetn-tape2.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-boetn-tape2.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above left: Remove the tape along the bottom and right side of
    the panel that secures the metal outer frame to the inner plastic
    frame, backlight bracket, and rear reflector.  Also remove the two
    black screws, one on the left and one on the right (blue arrows),
    that attach the metal frame to the bottom of the plastic inner
    frame.
  </p>
  <p>Above right: Panel after tape and screw removal.  The protective
    white tape along the right of the screen covered three flexible
    cable tabs that curl from the front of the screen and protrude
    slightly above the frame.  Take care handling the tabs as their
    connection to the glass LCD layer is fragile.</p>
</div>

<p>Leave the flexible tabs along the right side of the panel exposed
for now; be careful not to abuse them by tugging, yanking, or shocking
them (flexing is fine, just touching them also won't break anything).
Do not replace the black screws we removed from the sides of the
frame, as we still need to pop the metal frame open later.

<h4>Breaking the backlight bracket ground connection</h4>

<p>The next few steps are optional to prevent any accidental short
circuits between the LED supply and a grounded backlight bracket.  A
short to ground will blow either the fuse on the inverter board
(there's only one), or fuse F2 on the top of the motherboard between the
LCD cable connector and the processor socket.</p>

<ol start=3>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the two tiny black screws on the back of the panel that
      connect the backlight bracket to the two metal side-mounting
      clips (one on each side).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The side-mounting clips both provide the mounting threads for
      the hinges and connect the backlight bracket to ground.  To
      sever the ground path, we cut off the tab that connects to the
      backlight bracket.  The connecting tabs can simply be bent back
      and cut with diagonals, though this will probably leave a raised
      sharp edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I prefer to remove the clips, make a clean cut cut,
      and replace. The clips wrap around the plastic inner frame, so
      it's necessary to pop open a few of the hasps holding the outer
      metal and inner plastic frames together, separate the halves by
      a few millimeters, pull each clip free, cut it, return it to the
      plastic frame, then close the metal frame back into position.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Return the two small screws that fasten the backlight bracket to
      the plastic frame.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  out of the panel.  Removing the clip allows for a cleaner cut.</p>
  <p>Above right: Picture of the removed mounting clip after cutting
  off the tab that provides a ground path for the metal backlight

  frame.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Remove the white and the yellow pieces of polyester tape along
      the bottom and sides of the panel that secure the frame,
      backlight bracket, and rear reflector surface to one another.
      Don't mess with the tape along the top of the screen.

  connection.</p>
</div>

<p>...and with that the Samsung screens are ready for CCFL removal.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="rem">CCFL removal</h2>

<p>The easiest way to remove the original CCFL is to snip the wires
free at both ends of the tube, trim away the thin plastic tabs holding
the backlight tube in place at both ends, and then carefully pull the
CCFL tube out of the panel.  We need to momentarily separate the metal
outer frame from the panel by a few millimeters, but there's no other
panel disassembly required. This removal strategy also clears the way
for easy, slide-in LED installation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Gently pop apart the snap-together hasps along the front of the
      panel and  one or two along each side using a small
      flat-blade screwdriver.  Raise the metal outer frame up and away
      from the inner white plastic frame by a few millimeters, just
      enough to expose the backlight wires.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Unthread the backlight wires from the inner white plastic frame
      and pull them forward out from the panel. On some panels
      (usually AFFS), the pink wire is already routed straight forward
      out of the frame.

      Using small needle-nose pliers, carefully pull the left-hand
      (black/white wire side) silicone boot out of the panel.  Extract
      only the boot; leave the wire and tube behind.  Don't worry if
      the boot tears or it's necessary to extract it as multiple
      pieces.  If the boot tears and pieces are left inside, poke them
      out later after removing the CCFL tube.

      Again using small needle nose pliers, grasp the remaining stub
      of the pink/red wire on the right-hand side of the panel and
      gently slide the tube out.  The tube will offer slight
      resistance due to one or more clear silicone o-rings that brace
      it within the channel. Pull gently and slowly.

<h2 id="ledin">LED installation: The Short Version for My Kits</h2>

<p>If you don't want to fiddle around with extracting every last
fraction of a percent of light out of the LED conversion, here's a
simple fitting process with reliable results.</p>

<p><em>Note: The thin layer of Teflon on Daylight LED
strips is intended to be left in place for installation.</em></p>

<h3>
<a href="led-short-most.jpg">
  <img class=rightpic src="led-short-most.jpg" />
</a>
The majority of screens</h3>

<p>We want the LED strip positioned with the PCB straight up-and-down,
and the LEDs pressed up against the screen's internal acrylic
waveguide.</p>

<p>Slide a thin (10mil, .25mm) plastic shim into the metal backlight
channel from the right side, the same side from which the CCFL wires
extended.  Then slide the LED strip into place in front of the shim,
also from the right side.  When sliding the LED strip into place, the
fit should be just a bit snug.  If the fit is loose, repeat the
process adding another shim behind the strip.  If the fit is too snug
or the LED strip will not slide into place at all, remove a shim.</p>

<p>Due to a slight constriction at the entrance to the backlight
channels of some screens, the best fit may be achieved with the shim
sitting slightly inside the panel from the entrance side, and the
entirely of the excess extending from the exit side.</p>

<p>Once you've found the desired fit, trim the excess shim material
and you're done.</p>

<h3>
SXGA screens that show LED ripples along the bottom</h3>

<p>Most SXGA panels (and several other high-PPI panels, like the
legendary R51 QXGA) will show a rippling LED pattern along the bottom
of the screen if the LEDs are pressed right against the waveguide as
above.  If you have one of these screens and it does not show a
pattern, you're a lucky bastard and I want to know more about it
:-)</p>

<div class=caption>
  <a class=left href="led-sxgaripple.jpg">
    <img src="led-sxgaripple.jpg" /></a>
  <a class=right href="led-sxgaripple-daylight.jpg">
    <img src="led-sxgaripple-daylight.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Left: 12.1&quot; SXGA screens usually show a rippling pattern along the bottom of the screen with most LED strips.<br />Right: A Daylight strip used with a front accordian shim avoids the vast majority of the pattern.</p>
</div>


<a href="led-short-sxga.jpg">
  <img class=rightpic src="led-short-sxga.jpg" />
</a>

<p>In any case, the screens that do show LED 'rippling' need to be fitted
differently.</p>

<p>Like before, we want the LED strip positioned with the PCB straight
up-and-down, but with a small air space between the waveguide and LED
strip. Instead of shimming the LED strip from behind, insert an
accordian shim in front of the LED strip.  The accordian strips are
exactly the right length (once installed and flattened out slightly),
so the easiest strategy is often to carefully feed it in along with
the strip.</p>

<p>Once inserted, verify the strip is situated vertically.  Fitting
is complete.</p>

<h2 id="ledin">LED installation: The Longer Version for All Kits</h2>

<p>The LED backlight strip slides into the empty backlight channel
from the right side, the same side from which the CCFL wires extended.
Nearly all of the strips that come in kits are 'universal' which means
they're purposely too small to fit securely as-is.  We'll need to shim
them so that they're situated properly. If the LED strip rotates in the
channel or sits too far back, the apparent screen illumination will
dim and shift toward yellow.</p>

<p><i>Several of the Chinese kits provide double-sided adhesive tape
and incomplete instructions suggesting the LEDs should be affixed
firmly to the back or bottom of the backlight reflector bracket that
held the CCFL. Don't do it. It sacrifices easily half the available
brightness of the LEDs. It places them too far away from the waveguide
and in the wrong position.  Unlike the CCFL we're replacing, we want
the LEDs to inject as much light as possible directly into the
waveguide, not rely on reflection.</p>

<p>Bonding the LEDs with tape is also a complex task that
requires completely disassembling the panel to extract the backlight
bracket, and then once the LED strip is installed, it can't be
removed.  LEDs last longer than CCFLs, but they're not immortal.  I
consider easy slide-out, slide-in replacement a virtue worth
preserving.</i></b>

<h4>Top-emitting and side-emitting LEDs</h4>

<p>Most kits, including mine, come with strips that use top-emitting
LEDs, that is, LEDs that shine directly out the top.  We want to
install these strips with the circuit board situated perfectly
vertically and, except on SXGA screens, the LEDs pressed right against
the internal acrylic waveguide.</p>

<p> A few kits (e.g., some of the xCCFL kits) come with side-emitting
LEDs.  These can't be mounted with the LEDs directly against the
waveguide as they're usually set in the middle of the PCB strip.  We
still want to mount them as close to the waveguide as possible, and
since the emission pattern of the side-emitting LEDs is actually
angled upwards (not directly to the side), with the LEDs rotated to
face downward slightly.</p>


<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-panel-topside.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-topside.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: Top-emitting LEDs (upper strip) shine straight up.
  Side-emitting LEDs (lower strip) emit [mostly] to the side.  The
  strongest lobe of the emission pattern is actually pointed up
  slightly.</p>
</div>

<h4>Shimming with Teflon/polyester strips</h4>

<p>Thin plastic shims are the easiest way to keep strips with
top-emitting LEDs in the proper position.  We only need to fill 10-40
mils of space, and small plastic sheets with tight thickness
tolerances are readily available from hobby supply stores in
.005&quot; through .05&quot; thicknesses.  I personally use PTFE
(Teflon) sheet, as this guarantees tight fits will still slide into
place easily with no binding.  However, the cheaper and easier to find
clear polyester sheets will also work well.  Avoid ABS and polystyrene;
they will soften as the LEDs get hot.</p>

<p>Although I personally no longer bother, you can adhere the shims to
the LED strip if you want to.  Polyester and teflon sheet are both
available with adhesive backings, or make adhesive shims by applying a
layer of adhesive transfer tape (e.g., Killer Red, which will adhere
nicely even to PTFE) to the plastic sheet, then cutting the strip on a
rotary-blade paper cutter. A straight-edge and hobby knife should also
work nicely given sufficient care.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-panel-shimcut.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-shimcut.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: A (trusty, rusty) rotary-blade paper cutter does precision
  work slicing thin strips off a plastic sheet.  The red stripe across
  the top of the Teflon in the picture above is a strip of Killer Red
  tape for making the resulting shims adhesive. </p>
</div>

<p>The specific shim dimensions need to be determined by measurement
(or trial and error) for each type of strip and screen.  Don't forget
to account for the shape of the specific backlight bracket, rounded
off inner corners, the narrowing in the front of the backlight bracket
where it clamps to the waveguide, and any protrusions into the
channel, such as the rear reflector sheet.</p>

<p> That said, the shim behind the LED strip is typically on the order
of 80 mils (2mm) high and 20 mils (.5mm) thick.  A thin strip along
the top and/or bottom isn't really necessary, but it can help secure
against rotation.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-panel-shim.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-shim.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: Close-up of a shimmed LED strip sliding into a Samsung TN
  panel. The necessary shims will be different for each screen and
  each kit, but this particular strip has two adhesive 10 mil strips
  (2mm high, .5mm thick) fixed to the back of the strip, and a narrow
  10 mil strip (.25mm thick) along the top and bottom.  The strip is a
  good fit that will not shift or rotate out of position.</p>
</div>

<h4>Shimming with Sugru</h4>

<p>The LED strips can also be shimmed into perfect position with a
self-curing modeling putty like Sugru.  This is also the only good
option for holding side-emitting LED strips in the proper slightly
down-rotated position.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Apply a generous blop of Sugru that's about three LEDs wide at
      4-6 positions along the back of the LED strip.  Knead each bead
      to wrap around the top and bottom being careful not to obscure
      the LED emitters.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Wait for the Sugru to cure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Carve each bead into the approximate shape of the backlight
      channel using a hobby (X-acto) knife. Pay most careful attention
      to the flat sides along the top, back, and bottom.  Taper the
      beads on both sides to ease entry and removal.</p>
    <p>It's best to be conservative, remove small slivers, check the
      fit one bead at a time, adjust, repeat.  Worst case, you remove
      too much and have to add more Sugru.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-panel-sugru.jpg">
    <img src="led-panel-sugru.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: Close-up of an xCCFL side-emitting LED strip shimmed with
  beads of carved Sugru.  Sugru remains pliable with a bit of give
  after curing, so perfect precision isn't required for a good
  fit.</p>
</div>

<p>The Sugru strategy may require some practice, but the end results
are as good as shimming with plastic strips. Like Teflon, Sugru is
inherently non-stick after cure and slides into place easily without
binding.  It's also good for plugging both sides of the backlight
channel after assembly to prevent light leakage from the sides of the
channel.</p>

<h4>Accordian strips and SXGA screens</h4>

<p>SXGA and other high-PPI screens naturally pass less light through
the glass matrix.  These screens use a different waveguide and prism design
that attempts to be more efficient by building one of the directional prism layers directly
into the waveguide.  This works very well for CCFL tubes, which give
uniform light across their entire length.  It's a serious complication
when using individual LEDs.</p>

<p>Packing wide-angle, low-profile LEDs as close together as possible
(which the Daylight strip does) helps a great deal. Placing a small
gap between the LEDs and the internal waveguide will, along with
everything else, take care of the rest of the problem.
Experimentation indicates the gap has to be air; using a plastic
spacer doesn't work.</p>

<p>This is where the accordian strip comes in.  Placed in front of the
LED strip, it adds an air gap by holding the LED strip away from the
waveguide, but also holds the LED strip firmly in place against the
backlight bracket.  Shims can still be added behind the LED strip to
adjust the size of the gap.</p>

<h2>Jam it in, Turn it on</h2>

<p>There's not much to final assembly as the shimming process has
already fitted the LED strip into the panel. Some black electrical
tape or a small plug of Sugru to cover the exposed openings on the
backlight channel are a good idea but hardly necessary.  On the tablet
screens, don't forget to return the metal clips to the panel's lower
tabs before mounting back into the lid.</p>

<p>The LED strip plugs into the modified LED driver/inverter, and the
inverter plugs into the LCD cable. Note that the connector between the
LCD cable and inverter isn't keyed in any way. On most
models, it's nearly impossible to connect backward, but it's easier to
connect the wrong way on X60 and X61 tablets.  If you do connect it
upside-down/backward, you'll blow fuse F2 on the motherboard.  Consult
the image below for correct orientation.</p>

    <img src="led-panel-tabletconnect.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: It's possible to connect X60 and X61 tablet inverters to the LCD cable backward; doing so will blow fuse F2 on the motherboard.  The image above shows the correct orientation of the cable.  The inverter is shown in mounting position.</p>
</div>
<p> Lastly, connect the screen to the LCD cable as well and test
everything out.  Reassemble the lid and enjoy the new backlight.</p>
