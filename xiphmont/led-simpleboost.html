<p>This driver is a simple boost convertor with constant-current
  output.  Some vendors sell it with an additional flat-ribbon
  connector, most sell it with the ribbon connector missing and
  those solder pads left bare as in the pic above. The identifcation
  marks on the controller IC are usually ground off; I don't know
  why some Chinese vendors do this. The IC is the DF6113 boost
  controller popular in many LED drivers, and this board's design is
  straight off of the <a href="DF6113.pdf">DF6113's
    datasheet</a>.
</p>

<div class=caption>
  <img class=schematic src="led-simpleboost-schematic.png" />
  <p>Above: Schematic of stock, unmodified &quot;Simpleboost&quot; LED
  driver board</p>
</div>

<p>The LEDs provided with the kit must be arranged in at least 10S
  strings for Thinkpads with internal 20V power (like the
  X60/61-series) else the LEDs will never go out completely even
  when the machine is 'off'. It seems these 12.1&quot;/255mm kits
  usually come with 60 LEDs in 10S/6P; that works fine.</p>

<p>This controller board requires modification (such as the one below)
  for use with a Thinkpad.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="pwm">PWM-mode Mod</h2>

<p>The PWM mod alters the driver board slightly to use the Thinkpad's
  PWM brightness signal as a direct backlight switching control. The
  PWM frequency is 200Hz unless the OS changes it. If backlight
  flicker bothers you, definitely use <a href="led-kit.html">one of
  my continuous-mode driver boards</a> instead.</p>

    PWM-mode operation with a Thinkpad.  Red marks new or altered
    components and connections, light gray shows removed
    connections and components.</p>
</div>

<h3 class=center>parts needed</h3>

<ol>
  <li>1n4148 diode (through-hole DO35 recommended)</li>
  <li>3.9&ohm; resistor (SMD 1206 recommended)</li>
  <li>50V 1&micro;F capacitor (SMD tantalum recommended)</li>
</ol>

<p>Specific package recommendations above are known to fit, but
  feel free to use either surface mount or through-hole components as
  convenient. Resistor values should be 1% tolerance for best
  results.</p>

<h3 class=center>modification process</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Remove the resistor marked '243', located below and to the
    right of the controller IC.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Solder the cathode of a 1n4148 diode to the now unused left
    pad exposed by removing the resistor in step 1.  Solder the
    anode of the diode to pin 4 of the controller IC.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Replace the large orange 10&micro;F tantalum output filter
    capacitor (marked 106T) with a 1&micro;F output capacitor rated
    for 50V.  This step
    is not strictly necessary, but without it, the dimming range
    will be very small (3:1 or less).
  </li>
  
  <li>[optional] Replace the two 10&ohm; current sense resistors
    (marked 100, to the right of the output filter capacitor) with
    a single 3.9&ohm; resistor.  This increases the regulated
    output current from 85mA to 110mA.
  </li>
</ol>

    from stock are circled in red. Click for a larger image.</p>
</div>

<p>After modding, the DIM input is now the board enable and the
  ENA input is now a PWM-compatible brightness input (they're
  mostly interchangeable really, but reversing them will alter the
  output current drive slightly.</p>

<h3 class=center>trim-to-fit</h3>

<p>If there's no space to stash the LED driver PCB somewhere in
  the lid (or if you simply find adding the extra board
  inelegant), the driver PCB can be trimmed down to fit directly onto
  a stock Thinkpad inverter board. We only need to relocate the
  current sense resistor from the right to the left side of the
  output capacitor.</p>

<ol start=5>
  <li>
    Expose a portion of the LED- and ground traces immediately
    to the left of the output filter capacitor by carefully
    scraping away some of the blue conformal coating.  See the
    image below for the correct location.
  </li>
</ol>

    relocating the current sense resistor; expose the circled trace
    areas to make new pads for the resistor. Click for a larger
    image.</p>
</div>

<ol start=6>
  <li>
    Move the 3.9&ohm; resistor to the newly exposed solder pads.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using diagonal cutters, part the board along the left side
    of the inductor and to the right of the output filter
    capacitor. 
  </li>
</ol>

    intended to be soldered onto a Thinkpad inverter.  Mouse over

</div>

<p>Note that we've cut the power supply decoupling capacitor off
  along with the input connector.  We don't need it in this case;
  the DF6113 is a fairly stable controller and we'll use a
  decoupling capacitor as our power tap when
  we <a href="led-inverter.html">graft the driver onto an inverter
    board</a>.
