<p>ThinkPad LED Driver #3 (TLD3) is a slight refinement of
layout <a href="led-TLD1.html">TLD1</a>, replacing the brightness
range trim and shaping resistors with two multiturn cermet
potentiometers.  They allow trimming a TLD3 board for any model
without soldering.</p>

<p>Like TLD1, the TLD3 is a buck-topology LED driver based on
the <a href="tps92510-2.pdf">Texas Instruments TPS92510</a> controller
IC.  It provides a single channel of dimmable current-regulated output
intended for 3S LED strings operating between 7V to 9.6V and a design
output current of 600mA from an unregulated input of 10-24V.<p>

<h2>Brightness step and range adjustment</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="led-kit.html#FAQ">FAQ</a>, CCFL
ThinkPads all use the same brightness control system, but different
ThinkPads use different brightness ranges and step spacing designed to
work with specific CCFL lamps. LEDs behave differently, and the LED
driver boards must be 'trimmed' for the best behavior with a given
model's brightness range. </p>

<p>The TLD3 board includes two potentiometers that allow it to be
trimmed for any model, or adjusted by the user to suit their own
preferences.</p>

<p>Both potentiometers are multiturn cermets with a full adjustment
range of 11 turns.  When adjusted past either end of the range, the
potentiometer wiper 'idles' and up to a full turn in the opposite
direction is required before the wiper starts moving again.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-TLD3-adjust.jpg">
    <img src="led-TLD3-adjust.jpg" />
  </a>
  <p>Above: Two potentiometers on the TLD3 adjust the shape of the brightness step spacing and the minimum brightness setting.</p>
</div>

<h3>Left potentiometer: linear / exponential step spacing</h3>

<p>The left-hand potentiometer adjusts step spacing toward a more
exponential step spacing in the clockwise direction, and toward a more
linear spacing in the counter-clockwise direction.  Linear
spacing makes brighter steps feel closer together and dimmer steps
feel farther apart.  Exponential spacing does the opposite, making
brighter steps feel farther apart and dimmer steps closer
together.</p>

<p>Starting from a full-counterclockwise position, the first turn or
so (once the adjustment starts moving) is not in the useful adjustment
range.  Until adjustment has reached the first full turn, low
brightness steps will flicker slightly as the lowpass filter that
converts the ThinkPad's PWM brightness signal to a smooth analog level
is not yet fully functioning.</p>

<h3>Right potentiometer: minimum brightness setting</h3>

<p>The right potentiometer adjusts TLD3's output at the ThinkPad's
minimum brightness setting. Clockwise increases the minimum brightness
output, and counter-clockwise decreases it. Note the the TLD3 has an
inherent minimum output of about 7-10mA.  Attemting to adjust below
this level has no affect on the minimum brightness setting, and will
also decrease the brightness level of steps above minimum.</p>

<h3>Default setting: X41, X61T</h3>

<p>This adjustment process restores a default X41 adjustment.</p>

<p>If an ammeter is available, place it inline with one leg or the
other of the LED strip.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the Thinkpad to one step below maximum brightness</li>
<li>Adjust the left (step spacing) potentiometer so that the ammeter
reads 400mA</li>
<li>Set the ThinkPad to the lowest brightness step</li>
<li>Adjust the right (min brightness) potentiometer such that output
reads 30mA</li>
<li> Each adjustment slightly affects the other, so repeat steps 1-4
until the adjustments don't move (one to two more times)</li>
</ol>

<p>Rough adjustment is still possible if an ammeter is not available:
<ol><li>Turn the both potentiometers counterclockwise 13 turns, thus
making sure they're idling at the full counterclockwise adjustment</li>
<li>Turn the left (step spacing) potentiometer back clockwise 4 turns</li>
<li>Set the ThinkPad to minimum brightness</li>
<li>Turn the right (min brightness) potentiometer clockwise until the exact point it begins to raise the brightness</li>
<li>Continue turning the same (right) potentiometer clockwise 1 and 1/2 more turns</li>
</ol>

<h3>Default setting: X60, X60s, X60T (updated 2016/12/05)</h3>

<p>This adjustment process restores a default X60 adjustment.</p>

<p>Note: An X60, X60s or X60T machine using Coreboot or Libreboot
  behaves more like an X61 where backlight adjustment is concerned.
  Windows 10 will also set a n X61-like brightness stepping. The
  adjustment outlined here will work either way.</p>

<p>If an ammeter is available, place it inline with one leg or the
other of the LED strip.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the Thinkpad to one step below maximum brightness</li>
<li>Adjust the left (step spacing) potentiometer so that the ammeter
reads 345mA</li>
<li>Set the ThinkPad to the lowest brightness step</li>
<li>Adjust the right (min brightness) potentiometer such that output
reads 48mA</li>
<li> Each adjustment slightly affects the other, so repeat steps 1-4
until the adjustments don't move (one to two more times)</li>
</ol>

<p>Rough adjustment is still possible if an ammeter is not available:
<ol><li>Turn the both potentiometers counterclockwise 13 turns, thus
making sure they're idling at the full counterclockwise adjustment</li>
<li>Turn the left (step spacing) potentiometer back seven turns</li>
<li>Set the ThinkPad to minimum brightness</li>
<li>Turn the right (min brightness) potentiometer clockwise until the exact point it begins to raise the brightness</li>
<li>Continue turning the same (right) potentiometer clockwise for 1 and 7/8 more of a turn</li>
</ol>

<h3>Default setting: X61, X61s, X61T</h3>
 
<p>This adjustment process restores a default X61 adjustment.</p>
<p>If an ammeter is available, place it inline with one leg or the
other of the LED strip.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the Thinkpad to one step below maximum brightness</li>
<li>Adjust the left (step spacing) potentiometer so that the ammeter
reads 500mA</li>
<li>Set the ThinkPad to the lowest brightness step</li>
<li>Adjust the right (min brightness) potentiometer such that output
reads 24mA</li>
<li> Each adjustment slightly affects the other, so repeat steps 1-4
until the adjustments don't move (one to two more times)</li>
</ol>

<p>Rough adjustment is still possible if an ammeter is not available:
<ol><li>Turn the both potentiometers counterclockwise 13 turns, thus
making sure they're idling at the full counterclockwise adjustment</li>
<li>Turn the left (step spacing) potentiometer back clockwise 10 turns</li>
<li>Set the ThinkPad to minimum brightness</li>
<li>Turn the right (min brightness) potentiometer clockwise until the exact point it begins to raise the brightness</li>
<li>Continue turning the same (right) potentiometer clockwise for 1/2 more of a turn</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>In addition to the below, <a href="led-TLD1.html#design">design
requirements and notes from TLD1</a> still apply.</p>

<h3>Potentiometers and component choices</h3>

<p>The adjustable range of TLD3 required revision of capacitance
values in the PWM-to-analog lowpass, as well as co-opting the current
sense decoupling capacitor C6 into being a more active part of the
filter.  This was to even out the time-constant behavior of the
lowpass across the adjustment range such that the lowpass would smooth
adequately without overly damping brightness changes.</p>

<p>For good measure, I also reduced current flow within the dimming
circuit, as the current flows across both wipers of both
potentiometers.</p>

<h3>Vertical component placement</h3>

<p>All passives on the TLD3 board are now oriented vertically in an
attempt to reduce their exposure to board flex during installation and
handling.</p>

<h3>Powdered-iron inductor</h3>

<p>Although TLD3 runs at 350kHz, I was surprised to find in testing
that several molded powdered-iron core inductors performed as well as
the ferrite inductors I'd been using in TLD1 and TLD2.  The inductors
also had significantly higher current and saturation ratings, and were
more physically robust.</p>

<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>TLD3 is a revision of the original TLD1 prototype taking into
account several minor refinements.  As of May 2016, TLD3 replaces the
use of TLD1 and TLD2 in Daylight (600mA) kits for all Thinkpad
models.</p>
