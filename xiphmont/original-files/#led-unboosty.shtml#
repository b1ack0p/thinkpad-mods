    <p>This kit is based on the same DF6113 boost controller
      IC <a href="DF6113.pdf">[datasheet]</a> as
      the <a href="led-simpleboost.shtml">"Simpleboost" kit</a>, but
      arranged to use the inductor control as a low-side buck-down
      converter(!)  The driver board expects to drive a
      constant-current LED string at between 8 and 12 volts such as
      the usual 9.6V constant-current strips that can be trimmed in
      groups of three LEDs. This board requires one of the below
      modifications to work properly with a Thinkpad.</p>

    <p><b><span style="color: red;">WARNING:</span> the kits I tested
      came with driver boards configured to put out over an amp
      despite including 12.1&quot;/255mm strips rated for a maximum
      continuous operating current of 320mA. Operating these strips at
      an amp will damage them quickly. If you want to test your kit
      and strips before modding, either tie the DIM input to
      a 3.5V-5V source or replace the current sense resistors
      first!</b></p>

    </div>

    <hr>
    <h2 id="pwm">Mod One: PWM-mode</h2>

    <p>The PWM mod is the simpler of the two mods for this kit. It
      alters the driver board to use the Thinkpad's PWM brightness
      signal as a direct backlight switching control. The PWM
      frequency is 60Hz unless the OS changes it. If backlight flicker
      bothers you, definitely use the continuous-drive mod
      instead.</p>

	PWM-mode operation with a Thinkpad.  Red marks new or altered
	components and connections, light gray shows removed
	connections and components.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Feel free to use either surface mount or through-hole
      components as convenient. Resistor values should be 1%
      tolerance for best results.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Remove C5 completely.</li>

      <li>Remove R3 completely.</li>

      <li>Replace the current sense resistors R4 and R7 with 2.2&ohm;
      and 3.0&ohm; values. Alternately, a single 1.3&ohm; resistor is
      a close substitution, but gives slightly lower output.</li>

      <li>Solder the cathode of a 1N4148 diode to the left hand pad of
      the former R3; solder the anode to the lower exposed pad of the
      former C5.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class=caption>
      <a href="led-unboosty-pwm-untrimmed-large.jpg"><img src="led-unboosty-pwm-untrimmed.jpg" /></a>
      <p>Above: LED driver board after PWM mod.  Changes
      from stock are circled in red.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After modding, the DIM input is now the board enable and the
      ENA input is now a PWM-compatible brightness input (they're
      mostly interchangeable really, but this arrangement is slightly
      preferable). The board will put out approximately 320mA at max
      brightness. Minimum brightness depends somewhat on PWM
      frequency; the PWM signal switches the chip enable and the
      converter has some turn-on lag.  At the BIOS default of 60Hz,
      min brightness is about 40mA average for an adjustment range of
      8:1.</p>

    <p>If there's no space to stash the LED driver PCB somewhere in
      the lid (or if you simply find adding the extra board
      inelegant), the driver PCB can be cut down to fit directly
      onto a stock Thinkpad inverter board. The circuit is the same as
      above, but we need to relocate some components.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Begin by cutting along the indicated
	lines; diagonal cutters will make a clean, easy cut.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class=caption>
      <a href="led-unboosty-cut-large.jpg"><img src="led-unboosty-cut.jpg" /></a>
      <p>Above: The full LED driver is too large to graft onto an
      existing Thinkpad inverter. Cut the PCB board at the dotted
      lines using diagonal cutters to make it small enough to
      fit. Some of the components on the cut-off sections will need to
      be relocated onto the remaining PCB.</p>
    </div>    

    <p>The large orange 1&micro;F tantalum input capacitor (C6), the
      10&micro;F ceramic output filter capacitor (C7), and 10&ohm;
      input decoupling resistor (R1) that were cut off must all be
      added back onto the remaining board section.  Keep in mind the
      the tantalum capacitor is polarized!</p>

    <ol start=2>
      <li>Relocate output filter cap C7 to the remaining section of
      the board.  It should fit nicely between L1 and D1, if not, move
      L1 a bit to the left. C7 is non-polarized; solder one side to the
      upper pad of L1 and the other to the lower pad of D1 using
      additional leads.</li>
      <li>Relocate the tantalum input cap C6 to the remaining section
      of board; it will fit in the space to the left of Q1.  In the
      picture below it's mounted upside down for convenience. Use
      additional leads to solder the + side to the lower pad of D1
      (and the relocated C7) and the - side of the cap to ground, (e.g.
      the lower pad of R4).</li>
      <li>Rather than reusing R1, solder a through-hole resistor from
      IC pin 1 to the + side of the relocated tantalum capacitor
      C6. Any value between 10&ohm; and 200&ohm; is fine. The schematic
      indicates 10&ohm;, I actually used 100&ohm; in the pictures.</li>
      <li>Solder one lead of a 4.7k&ohm; resistor to pin 4 of the IC; the
      other lead becomes our DIM input.</li>
      <li>Solder the anode of a 1N4148 diode to pin 4 of the IC as
      well.  The cathode becomes our ENA input.</li>
      <li>Make a solder pad for the LED- connection by scraping the
      conformal covering off the trace right under the 'D1' printing,
      and tinning the exposed copper.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once the assembly tests OK, it's a good idea to fix the added
      components into place with a generous amount of cyanoacrylate
      glue to prevent the exposed leads from shifting
      unintentionally. Then the trimmed driver PCB is ready to
      be <a href="led-inverter.shtml#graft">grafted onto an existing
      Thinkpad backlight inverter</a>. </p>

    <hr>
    <h2 id="cont">Mod Two: Continuous-drive</h2>

    <p>The Unboosty continuous-drive mod is more complex than the
    PWM-mode mod (perhaps approaching the line where it might just be
    less trouble to construct a fresh PCB design), but the result is
    flicker free, higher efficiency, and also has a much wider
    brightness adjustment range.</p>

    <div class=caption>
      <img style="width: 800px;"
	   src="led-unboosty-schematic-continuous-over.png" />
      <p>Above: Schematic of the Unboosty driver board modified for
      continuous-drive operation with a Thinkpad.  Red marks new or
      altered components and connections, light gray shows removed
      connections and components.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Modding the Unboosty board for Thinkpad-compatible continuous
    drive requires swapping three resistor values and adding five new
    components (R3 is removed and replaced with another resistor
    elsewhere on the board, but in the same position on the
    schematic).  Again, mix through-hole and surface mount as
    convenient and use 1% tolerance resistors for the best
    results. Starting with a whole board modification as before:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Remove C5 completely.</li>
      <li>Remove R3 completely.</li>
      <li>Replace the current sense resistors R4 and R7 with
      values 1.8&ohm; and 3.9&ohm;.</li>
      <li>Replace resistor R6 with value 12k&ohm;.</li>
      <li>Solder one lead/pad of a 330k&ohm; resistor to pin 6 of the DF6113.</li>
      <li>Solder one lead/pad of a .1&micro;F capacitor (25V minimum) to pin 7 of the DF6113.</li>
      <li>Solder together the unattached leads/pads of the resistor from step 5 and
	the capacitor from step 6.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class=caption>
      <a href="led-unboosty-continuous1-large.jpg"><img src="led-unboosty-continuous1.jpg" /></a>
      <p>Above: Unboosty driver board after steps 1-7 of the
	continuous-mode mod. Changes from stock are circled in red.  The
	two surface mount components soldered to pins 6 and 7 of the
	driver IC are soldered together on the right side; the diode
	cathode will also be soldered to this connection in step 10.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you're using surface mount components in steps 5 through 7
    (as in the picture above) be careful; SMDs are designed to be
    soldered to pads on the PCB, not to each other, and some have lead
    connections that are easy to crack or pry off by accident.  For
    example, you might be tempted to solder the 330k&ohm; resistor
    from step 5 between R6 and the .1&micro;F capacitor attached to
    pin 7.  Chaining SMD components together this way is likely to
    fracture internal connections on the components if the chain is
    disturbed or flexed (including during assembly).  A broken
    connection here would result in a circuit that may seem to work,
    but not entirely correctly.</p>

    <p>Continuing with the modification:</p>

    <ol start=8>
      <li>Solder the source of an N-channel FET (such as a 2N7000 or
	ZVN2106A) to the ground (lower) pad of R5.</li>
      <li>Solder the drain of the N-channel FET to the anode of a 1N4148.</li>
      <li>Solder the cathode of the 1N4148 to the connection of the resistor and capacitor made in step 7.</li>
      <li>Solder a wire from the gate of the N-channel FET and the
	left hand pad of the former R3.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class=caption>
      <a href="led-unboosty-continuous2-large.jpg"><img src="led-unboosty-continuous2.jpg" /></a>
      <p>Above: Completed continuous-mode Unboosty mod showing the
      resistor, diode and transistor added in steps 8-11.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After modding, the DIM input converts the Thinkpad PWM input to
      an analog continuous-drive adjustment.  The board will put out
      approximately 320mA at max brightness and 15mA at minimum
      brightness for an adjustment range of a little over 20:1.  The
      adjustment steps are spaced non-linearly with larger steps at
      high brightness.</p>

    <p>As with the PWM mod, we can also construct a cut-down version of
      the continuous-mode driver that will fit onto an existing
      Thinkpad inverter board. Again the circuit is the same but we
      need to relocate some components.</p>

    <p>The mod begins the same as before, but we don't need to remove
      R3 or C5 as they'll be cut off later anyway.  The steps are
      mostly the same, but for the sake of keeping everything clear,
      let's restart the mod from the beginning:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Replace the current sense resistors R4 and R7 with
      values 1.8&ohm; and 3.9&ohm;.</li>
      <li>Replace resistor R6 with value 12k&ohm;.</li>
      <li>Solder one lead/pad of a 330k&ohm; resistor to pin 6 of the DF6113.</li>
      <li>Solder one lead/pad of a .1&micro;F capacitor (25V minimum) to pin 7 of the DF6113.</li>
      <li>Solder together the unattached leads/pads of the resistor from step 5 and
	the capacitor from step 6.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class=caption>
      <a href="led-unboosty-continuous1-trimmed-large.jpg"><img src="led-unboosty-continuous1-trimmed.jpg" /></a>
      <p>Above: Unboosty driver board after steps 1-5 of the
	continuous-mode mod for a cut-down board. Changes from stock
	are circled in red.  The two surface mount components soldered
	to pins 6 and 7 of the driver IC are soldered together on the
	right side; the diode cathode will also be soldered to this
	connection in step 8.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Continue adding components:</p>

    <ol start=6>
      <li>Solder the source of an N-channel FET (such as a 2N7000 or
	ZVN2106A) to the ground (lower) pad of R5.</li>
      <li>Solder the drain of the N-channel FET to the anode of a 1N4148.</li>
      <li>Solder the cathode of the 1N4148 to the connection of the resistor and capacitor made in step 5.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The large orange 1&micro;F tantalum input capacitor (C6), the
      10&micro;F ceramic output filter capacitor (C7), and 10&ohm;
      input decoupling resistor (R1) all must be relocated off the
      parts of the board that will be cut away. Keep in mind the the tantalum capacitor is
      polarized!</p>

    <ol start=9>
      <li>Relocate output filter cap C7 to between L1 and D1. If it
	does not fit, move L1 a bit to the left. C7 is non-polarized;
	solder one side to the upper pad of L1 and the other to the
	lower pad of D1 using additional leads.</li>
      
      <li>Relocate the tantalum input cap C6 to the space between Q1
	and L1.  In the picture it's mounted upside down for
	convenience. Use additional leads to solder the + side to the
	lower pad of D1 (and the relocated C7) and the - side of the cap
	to ground, (e.g. the lower pad of R4).</li>

      <li>Solder one lead of a 220k&ohm; resistor to the + side of the
	tantalum cap (the relocated C6 from the previous step). Solder
	the other lead to the drain of the MOSFET, a connection shared
	with the anode of the 1N4148 diode.</li>

      <li>Rather than reusing R1, solder a through-hole resistor from
	IC pin 1 to the + side of the relocated tantalum capacitor C6
	(or, as in the picture, to the lead of the 220k&ohm; resistor
	that already connects to the capacitor's + terminal). Any value
	between 10&ohm; and 200&ohm; is fine. The schematic indicates
	10&ohm;, I actually used 100&ohm; in the pictures.</li>
    </ol>

      <li>Make a solder pad for the LED- connection by scraping the
