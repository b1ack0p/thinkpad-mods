<p>The CCFL tubes used in LCD backlights dim, shift color, and
  eventually go out as they age. CCFL-equipped laptops more than a few
  years old usually need or can benefit from a new backlight.</p>

<p>Most recent laptops use LED backlights instead of CCFL tubes.  LEDs
  are now more power efficient and typically last longer. They're also
  easier to install in older CCFL-equipped LCD panels than a new
  CCFL.</p>

<p><a href="led-kit.html"><del>I make and sell kits and individual
parts</del></a> for converting several ThinkPad models to LED backlight.
  My kits are designed specifically for ThinkPads; they plug in with
  no soldering, use the original brightness controls, offer a wide
  brightness range with no flickering, and improved color rendering
  over the original CCFL backlight.</p>

<p><a href="led-panel.html">Installation is straightforward though
  there's some DIY involved</a>.  You'll need to open up the lid,
  remove the screen and inverter board, extract the CCFL tube from the
  screen, install the new LED strip and driver board, and get
  everything back together.</p>

<p class=aside>(If you're looking for my older pages on modding and
  using LED kits from Chinese vendors, <a href="led-chinese.html">
  I've kept them around for historical purposes</a>.  There are
  probably still useful bits in there for other modders. That said, I
  started making my own LED conversions because I wasn't particularly
  satisfied with the performance of any of the Chinese kits.)</p>

<h2>This process is not foolproof</h2>

<p>This is the obvious disclaimer; the information presented here
  is correct to the best of my knowledge, but naturally, you're
  proceeding at your own risk.  There are plenty of easy mistakes
  that will kill the kit, the LCD panel, or the computer
  itself. Even if you know what you're doing, there's the chance a
  moment's inattention will permanently damage the machine.</p>

<h2>Expected LED life</h2>

<p>I measured the 3.5 year old backlight in my X61T against a brand
  new panel; it was down to only 22% of its original maximum
  brightness!  LEDs <em>should</em> last considerably longer-- I guess
  we'll find out in a few years if that's actually true. Panels
  designed for CCFLs don't dissipate heat efficiently, and heat is the
  primary enemy of an LED's longevity.</p>

<h2>Power efficiency</h2>

<p>The various LED backlights I've tested have been anywhere from 140%
  to 500% the brightness of brand new CCFL at 3W of output power.  LED
  driver boards are also more efficient than a CCFL inverter; at a 3W
  output drive, the total draw of a CCFL+inverter is about 4.2W.  An
  LED backlight+driver typically draws only about 3.5W to deliver the
  same 3W of useful output power. My new boards knock another 1/4 watt
  off this figure.</p>

<p>At minimum brightness, a CCFL+inverter draws 1/7th the power but
  produces only 1/25th the light.  Unlike a CCFL, LED efficiency
  increases at low brightness, so power savings over a CCFL further
  increases as you turn down the brightness.</p>

<h2>Dimmable range</h2>

<p>ThinkPads control brightness by varying the duty cycle of a 200 Hz
  pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal over a range of about 6:1.  This
  produces a 25:1 actual change in brightness with a new CCFL.  LED
  brightness is fairly linear, so most kits only provide a brightness
  range somewhere between 5:1 and 8:1.</p>

<p>(My kits emulate the brightness step spacing of the original
  backlight, and default to a 25:1 brightness range. The new TLD3
  driver boards will allow user-adjustment of both the range and the
  step spacing).</p>

<h2>Color accuracy</h2>

    Above: Spectrometer gamut measurements of an HV121P01-100 screen
    with its original CCFL backlight [left],<br />as fitted with an
    LED strip using general-purpose white LEDs [center],<br />and an
    LED strip using Nichia LEDs designed specifically for backlights
    [right].
    </p>
</div>

<p>A white LED does not produce the same spectrum as a CCFL even if
  the white looks the same to the naked eye.  The general purpose
  white LEDs used in all the other kits I've seen (as of 2016) have
  the usual white = blue+yellow construction resulting in a
  greenish-yellow-heavy spectra without much deep red; this is
  especially badly suited to low-power IPS and AFFS screens.  Even
  when white looks right, colors shift toward yellow with muted greens
  and muddy, orangish reds.</p>

<p>It's also impossible to guess exactly what LEDs you'll get with a
  generic kit.  When I was still modding Chinese kits, I'd place
  multiple orders for the same kit from the same vendor in the space
  of a single month, and each used different LED strips with different
  whitepoints.</p>

<p>If color rendering and consistency is
  important, my <a href="led-kit.html">'Daylight' kits</a> currently
  use a single bin (Btc72P10d22) of <a href="NSSW157F-HG-E.pdf">Nichia
  NSSW157FT-HG LEDs</a> specifically designed for backlights.  You can
  see a gamut measurement of one of these strips in an actual AFFS
  SXGA screen in <a href="led-NICHIAgamut.png">the right-hand plot above</a>.</p>

<h2>Low-frequency PWM, high-frequency PWM and continuous drive</h2>

<p>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) performs dimming by rapidly switching
  the backlight on and off at different duty cycles.  Phosphor
  persistence in a CCFL smooths out the low-frequency PWM flicker.
  There's no such smoothing with LEDs and some people vehemently
  dislike LED-lit panels with low-frequency PWM brightness
  controls.</p>

<p>High-frequency PWM avoids flicker by switching the backlight on and
  off at a much higher frequency, typically 20kHz instead of
  200Hz. This eliminates any hint of flicker while retaining advantages
  of PWM.</p>

<p>Continuous-drive controllers (like my boards) change brightness by
  varying the regulated drive current rather than switching the
  backlight on and off.  Continuous drive is both flicker-free and
  more power efficient at lower brightness settings.</p>

<h2>Continuous drive and color shift</h2>

<p>The color of an LED shifts slightly with drive voltage, drive
  current, and junction temperature.  The color at 100% brightness
  will not exactly match the color of the same LED at lower power.</p>

<p>PWM only ever drives the LEDs either at full power or not at all,
  so it's generally thought to be immune to color shift.  This is
  incorrect; <a href="http://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2014/feb/led-color-shift-under-pwm-dimming">PWM
  also shows color shift</a>.</p>

<p>Color shift isn't really an issue in practice either with PWM or
  continuous drive, at least not for these conversions.  Shift is
  easily measurable, just as it is with the original CCFL, but not
  particularly noticeable.</p>

  ranges of an original CCFL as compared to two different LED
  backlights operating in continuous-current mode.</p>

<h2>Other ThinkPad models</h2>

<p>I've personally tested my driver boards with the X41, X60, X61, and
  submodels.  Others have also fitted them to various T series
  including the T61 and T500.</p>

<p>The driver design assumes a 10V-20V internal power bus, active-high
  backlight enable and ~6:1 active-high PWM dimming (logic low &lt;
  1.0v, logic high &gt; 2.5V) The boards are fairly certain to work on
  most other ThinkPads as is, though I've not tested this.  I'll add
  other models as there's demand.</p>
