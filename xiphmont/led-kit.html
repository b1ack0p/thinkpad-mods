Everything Needed</h2>

<p>Converting a CCFL-equipped ThinkPad to use an LED backlight
requires an LED backlight driver to replace the CCFL inverter and an
LED backlight strip to replace the CCFL tube.  It's also useful to
have some thin plastic shims to fit the LED strip snugly in place.<p>

<p>The conversion kits below include all three items, which are also
available as individual parts.  The parts and kits come in two basic
flavors: the 'Original' kit and the new 'Daylight' kit.  From there,
the needed LED driver also depends on the model of ThinkPad.</p>

<hr />

<h2>
<a href="led-originalkit.jpg">

</a>
Original kit</h2>

<p>Original-version kits are available for the X41, X41T, X60, X60s, X60T, X61, X61s and X61T.</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop-in 335mA ThinkPad LED driver
<li>LED strip using general purpose lighting LEDs
<li>1.5mm x 300mm flat plastic shims
</ul>

<p>The Original kit uses a decent Chinese white LED strip paired with
one of my own driver boards.  The driver and LED strip are matched for
a max output of 335mA, the rated limit of the LED strip. At
full brightness, the LED strip uses 3.2W.</p>

<p>This kit is recommended for TN screens and will also work well with
AFFS XGA screens.  It is not recommended for SXGA screens, as most
HV121P01-100 and HV121P01-101 will show
a <a href="led-sxgaripple.jpg">rippling mirrored pattern from
individual LEDs</a> along the bottom inch or so of the screen. SXGA
screens require a Daylight kit,
which <a href="led-sxgaripple-daylight.jpg">eliminates the rippling
pattern</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a href="led-daylightkit.jpg">
  <img class=rightpic src="led-daylightkit.jpg" />
</a>
Daylight kit</h2>

<p>Daylight kits are available for the X41, X41T, X60, X60s, X60T, X61, X61s and X61T.</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop-in 600mA Daylight ThinkPad LED driver
<li>Daylight LED strip using <a href="NSSW157F-HG-E.pdf">Nichia NSSW157F-HG</a> LEDs
<li>1.5mm x 300mm flat and accordian plastic shims
</ul>

<p>The Daylight kit is an upgrade intended for XGA and SXGA AFFS
screens (i.e. "the really nice screens").  It pairs the new
range-adjustable TLD3 driver board with a custom LED strip using Nichia's
latest-generation component-phosphor LEDs designed specifically for
backlights. It's two to three times as bright as the Original kit with
substantially improved <a href="led-gamut.html">gamut coverage exceeding the original CCFL</a>.</p>

<p>The Nichia LEDs also allow Daylight kits to run at a higher 600mA
current compared to the Original kit.  At full brightness the LED
backlight uses 4.8W.</p>

<p>The use of closely-packed, wide-angle, low-profile LEDs along with
an accordian shim eliminates the 'rippling' pattern seen along the
bottom of SXGA screens when using other strips.</p>

<h2>
<a href="led-driver.jpg">
  <img class=rightpic src="led-driver.jpg" />
</a>
Individual backlight drivers</h2>

<p>LED backlight drivers are made by fitting custom LED driver boards
to existing ThinkPad inverter PCBs in place of the CCFL step-up coil.
This strategy leaves all the other functionality of the inverter board
completely in-tact.  The indicator LEDs still work, as do the sensors
and pushbuttons on the tablet models.</p>

<p>I currently use three different driver boards, imaginatively
named <a href="led-TLD1.html">ThinkPad LED Driver
1</a>, <a href="led-TLD2.html">ThinkPad LED Driver 2</a>,
and <a href="led-TLD3.html">ThinkPad LED Driver 3</a>.</p>

<p>TLD1 and TLD2 were the original test prototypes (which turned out
to work well.) TLD3 is an update of the TLD1 layout adding two
surface mount potentiometers that allow easy adjustment of the
brightness range and step spacing.</p>

<p>The <a href="led-TLD1.html">TLD1</a>, <a href="led-TLD2.html">TLD2</a>,
and <a href="led-TLD3.html">TLD3</a> boards are available alone or
pre-mounted to a ThinkPad inverter PCB.</p>

</a>
Individual LED backlight strips</h2>

<p>The 'Original' LED strips are Chinese white-LED strips originally
bought in a large batch through iCCFL.com.  I measured each strip
with a spectrometer and divided them by whitepoint into 'good for TN'
(warmer / higher CIE Y coordinate value) and 'good for AFFS' (colder /
lower CIE Y coordinate value).  I don't intend to stock more once
these are all gone, as the color-suitability of Chinese strips is so
hit-or-miss.</p>

<p>The 'Daylight' LED strips are all made from the same bin of Nichia
NSSW157F-HG LEDs.  The output spectrum is suitable for all AFFS
screens.  Colors will also be good with TN, though slightly cold
(about 7500-8000K).</p>

<p>Original strips for 4:3 12.1&quot; screens are trimmed to 250mm of
lit area.  Daylight strips are a slightly shorter 246mm to prevent
bright corners on SXGA screens.</p>

<h2>Shims</h2>

<p>The plastic shims used in these kits are simply 1.5mm by ~300mm
strips of Teflon or Mylar-D; any plastic with a working deformation
temperature above 100C is appropriate.</p>

<p>The thin shim strips are approximately 10-mil (.25mm) thick and the
thicker strips approximately 30-mil (.75mm).  Accordian strips are
5mil (.125mm) mylar cut along the grain, and folded into an accordian
with bends approximately a centimeter apart.</p>

	  <p><del>I'm happy to send shim strips</del> (and they're included in the kits),
but these materials should be available from any good hobby or
modeling shop.</p>

<h3>How bright can I expect an LED backlight to be?</h3>

<p>It depends on the screen and the kit.  Using the same LED strip, TN
screens are brightest, followed by the XGA AFFS screens, followed by
the SXGA screens.</p>

<p>An Original kit can be expected to hit 400 nits in a TN
screen and about 300 nits in an XGA AFFS screen.  A Daylight kit will
exceed 800 nits in an XGA screen, and reach somewhere between 550 and
750 nits in an SXGA screen depending on how the strip is fitted.</p>

<h3>Will colors look normal?</h3>

<p>An Original kit produces less saturated colors than the
original CCFL backlight.  Reds especially become somewhat muted.  The
screen will not look especially odd, but it will look noticably less
colorful.</p>

<p>A Daylight kit produces significantly better color than the
original CCFL, and comes much closer to ideal coverage of the standard
sRGB gamut, especially with AFFS screens.</p>

<h3>Is there any backlight flicker using these kits?</h3>

<p>No. The LED driver board converts the ThinkPad's PWM
brightness control signal to an analog level that regulates the
LED current.  The LEDs are powered by a steady, continuous current
across the entire brightness range.</p>

<h3>Do the indicator LEDs still work normally?</h3>

<p>Yes.  The status LEDs are unaffected by an LED upgrade.</p>

<h3>Do the ThinkPad brightness controls work normally?</h3>

<p>Yes. The custom driver boards are designed to use native ThinkPad brightness signaling.</p>

<h3>Why do e.g. the X60 and X61 need different LED drivers when they used the same CCFL inverter?</h3>

<p>LEDs are so much brighter than CCFLs that it's important to make
the brightness range and spacing as useful as possible.  For example,
we don't want the minimum brightness to be too bright to use
comfortably in dim lighting.</p>

<p>CCFL ThinkPads all use the same brightness control system, but
different ThinkPads use different brightness ranges and step
spacing.  The X60, for example, uses a relatively narrow,
exponentially spaced brightness range with 8 steps.  The X61 uses a
different, wider, 16-step linear spacing.</p>

<p>These spacings were designed to work with specific CCFL lamps. LEDs
behave differently, especially at low brightness levels.  As a result,
the LED driver boards must be 'trimmed' for the best behavior with a
given model's brightness range.</p>

<p>TLD1 and TLD2 boards are trimmed by soldering approriate resistors
into the level translation circuit, so they're assembled for specific
ThinkPad models.  The TLD3 board can be trimmed for any model via two
potentiometers, but it's still shipped out pre-adjusted for a given
model.</p>

<h3>Does the newest TLD3 board work better than the TLD1 and TLD2?</h3>

<p>TLD3 should be more physically robust to rough handling, but it
functions exactly the same.</p>

<p>The main difference is that the TLD1 and TLD2 boards must be
adjusted by desoldering and replacing trimming resistors, where the
TLD3 is adjusted via two potentiometers.</p>

<h3>Where can I find schematics, design docs, Gerbers, etc, for these parts?</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="led-TLD1.html">Driver board TLD1</a></li>
<li><a href="led-TLD2.html">Driver board TLD2</a></li>
<li><a href="led-TLD3.html">Driver board TLD3</a></li>
<li><a href="led-strip.html">Daylight LED strip</a></li>
<li><a href="led-inverter.html">Electrical connection points for LED drivers</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>May I use the schematics and Gerbers to make/sell my own boards?</h3>

<p>Go for it! Feel free to use and improve these designs any way you
wish.  If you want to make and sell parts (and save me the trouble),
be my guest!
