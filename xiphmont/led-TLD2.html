<p>ThinkPad LED Driver #2 (TLD2) was an alternate prototype designed
at the same time as <a href="led-TLD1.html">TLD1</a>. It is a
buck-topology LED driver based on the <a href="DS8450B-05.pdf">Richtek
8450B</a> controller IC.  Like TLD1, it provides a single channel of
dimmable current-regulated output intended for 3S LED strings
operating between 7V to 9.6V and a design output current of up to
600mA from an unregulated input of 10-24V.</p>

<p><a href="led-TLD1.html#design">Design requirements</a> are the
same as for TLD1.</p>

<h2>Design Notes</h2>

<p>TLD2 was originally intended to hedge my bets on TLD1.  It's a more
complex circuit around a more complex controller that's slightly less
efficient than TLD1 due to using a bipolar on-chip switch rather than
a MOSFET.</p>

<h3>PWM to analog level conversion</h3>

<p>The Richtek chip has built-in lowpass infrastructure intended to
convert an input PWM waveform to an analog level for dimming.
Translation is fairly linear.</p>

<p>The built-in conversion overshoots the top of the analog brightness
range slightly in order to guarantee that a 100% duty cycle saturates to
full brightness.  As a result, the top two brightness levels are
closer together than they should be otherwise.  Minimum brightness is
only about 1/6th the level of maximum brightness</p>

<p>U3, RA, RB, R3 and C5 form a supplemental brightness control
circuit intended to modify the built-in linear conversion with an
additional pullup and pulldown.  In practice, the TLD2 was only used on
X60 drivers, and only the pulldown is used (to reduce the minimum
brightness level).</p>

<h3>Overvoltage on inputs</h3>
<p>Unlike many driver chips, the various logic inputs are not rated to
VCC; exceeding the maximum input listed on the datasheet will damage
(but not entirely cripple) the chip.  The resulting misbehvior looks a
great deal like static discharge damage.</p>

<h2>Other Notes</h2>
<h3>Static Sensitivity</h3>
<p>The RT8450B is also easily static damaged, though not as easily as
the TPS92510.  Static damage usually manifests as regulation
metastability; output current unexpectedly fluctuates with changes in
input voltage. The circuit still works, it just 'acts funny'.<p>

<p>Assembled circuits appear to be more normally robust against
static, likely due to large external capacitances protecting the
relevant sense inputs.  As yet, I've not had an assembled board suffer
static damage.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Due to the 'max brightness' overshoot noted above, TLD2 was only
used in X60 drivers where the upper two brightness steps were so far
apart it made little difference.  50 hand-soldered boards from the
prototype run became the first generation of X60 LED kits (Original
and Daylight). With the introduction of TLD3, remaining TLD2 boards
will be used in 'Original' (335mA) X60 kits until the stock is
depleted.</p>
