<p>This kit is based on the same DF6113 boost controller
  IC <a href="DF6113.pdf">[datasheet]</a> as
  the <a href="led-simpleboost.html">"Simpleboost" kit</a>, but
  arranged to use the inductor control as a low-side buck-down
  converter(!)  The driver board expects to drive a constant-current
  LED string at between 8 and 12 volts such as the usual 9.6V
  constant-current strips that can be trimmed in groups of three
  LEDs. This board requires modification, such as the mod below, to
  work properly with a Thinkpad.</p>

<p class=in style="color: #bb4400;">
  <em>Update and Warning</em>: Oh well, it <em>seemed</em> like it worked
  well enough.  I've since gotten boards that flicker noticably with
  the slightest shift in input voltage, eg with processor load,
  regardless of the mod used.  There's no correcting the problem no
  matter how fancy the mod--- it's a consequence of lobotomizing a
  boost controller to use it in buck mode.</p>

<p class=in style="color: #bb4400;">
  <em>Warning #2: As shipped, the boards I bought for evaluation were
      configured to put out far too much current for the
      12.1&quot;/255mm LED strips included.  Do not try to test this
      kit without reading the modding page, or you'll probably damage
      the LED strip!

<h2 id="pwm">PWM-mode Mod</h2>

<p>The PWM mod alters the driver board to use the Thinkpad's PWM
  brightness signal as a direct backlight switching control. The PWM
  frequency is 200Hz unless the OS changes it.  If backlight
  flicker bothers you, definitely use <a href="led-kit.html">one of
  my continuous-mode driver boards</a> instead.</p>

</div>


<h3 class=center>parts needed</h3>
<ol>
  <li>1n4148 diode (SMD SOD-323 recommended, though through-hole works fine too)</li>
  <li>2.2&ohm; resistor (SMD 1206 recommended)
  <li>3.0&ohm; resistor (SMD 1206 recommended)
  <li>Low-profile 47&micro;H or 68&micro;H inductor, eg, Bourns SRR6028 <i>[only if <a href="led-inverter.html#clearance">grafting onto a non-tablet inverter</a>]</i></li>
  <li>A few centimeters of thin wire <i>[if building a trimmed version]</i></li>
</ol>

<p>Specific package recommendations above are known to fit, but feel
  free to mix whatever surface mount or through-hole components seem
  convenient. Resistor values should be 1% tolerance for best
  results.</p>

<h3 class=center>full-sized mod</h3>

<p>Most Thinkpad modders want the trimmed version of the mod described
in the next section. This is a less complicated process that leaves
the original full-sized board in-tact for alternate uses.

<ol>
  <li>Remove C5 completely.</li>
  
  <li>Remove R3 completely.</li>
  
  <li>Replace the current sense resistors R4 and R7 with 2.2&ohm;
    and 3.0&ohm; values. Alternately, a single 1.3&ohm; resistor is
    a close substitution, but gives slightly lower output.</li>
  
  <li>Solder the cathode of a 1N4148 diode to the left hand pad of
    the former R3; solder the anode to the lower exposed pad of the
    former C5.</li>
</ol>

    <img src="led-unboosty-pwm-untrimmed-large.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: LED driver board after PWM mod.  Changes
    from stock are circled in red.</p>
</div>

<p>After modding, the DIM input is now the board enable and the
  ENA input is now a PWM-compatible brightness input (they're
  mostly interchangeable really, but this arrangement is slightly
  preferable). The board will put out approximately 320mA at max
  brightness. Minimum brightness depends somewhat on PWM
  frequency; the PWM signal switches the chip enable and the
  converter has some turn-on lag.  At the BIOS default of 60Hz,
  min brightness is about 36mA average for an adjustment range of
  9:1.</p>

<h3 class=center>trimmed mod</h3>

<p>If there's no space to stash the LED driver PCB somewhere in
  the lid (or if you simply find adding the extra board
  inelegant), the driver PCB can be trimmed to fit directly
  onto a stock Thinkpad inverter board. The circuit is the same as
  above, but we need to relocate some components.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Begin by cutting along the indicated lines; diagonal cutters
    will make a clean, easy cut.  That's all the trimming necessary to
    fit onto a tablet-model inverter, but if we're grafting this board onto
    a non-tablet inverter, we'll also need to file down the top and
    bottom edges by about a millimeter. It might also be necessary
    to swap for a lower-profile inductor. See
    the <a href="led-inverter.html#clearance">section about
    dimensional restrictions on the inverter page</a>.</li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-unboosty-cut-large.jpg">
    <img src="led-unboosty-cut-large.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: The full LED driver is too large to graft onto an
    existing Thinkpad inverter. Cut the PCB board at the dotted
    lines using diagonal cutters to make it small enough to
    fit. Some of the components on the cut-off sections will need to
    be relocated onto the remaining PCB.</p>
</div>    

<p>The large orange 1&micro;F tantalum input capacitor (C6), the
  10&micro;F ceramic output filter capacitor (C7), and 10&ohm;
  input decoupling resistor (R1) that were cut off must all be
  added back onto the remaining board section.  Keep in mind the
  the tantalum capacitor is polarized!</p>

<ol start=2>
  <li>Relocate output filter cap C7 to the remaining section of the
    board.  It should fit nicely between L1 and D1, if not, move L1 a
    bit to the left. C7 is non-polarized; solder one side to the lower
    pad of D1 and the side other to the upper pad of L1 using an additional
    wire lead.</li>
  <li>Relocate the tantalum input cap C6 to the remaining section of
    board; it will fit in the space to the left of Q1.  In the picture
    below it's mounted upside down for convenience. Use additional
    wire leads to solder the + side to the lower pad of D1 and the
    relocated C7 (the red wire in the picture below) and the - side of
    the cap to ground, e.g.  the lower pad of R4 (connected directly
    via a solder bridge in the picture below).</li>
  <li>Rather than reusing R1, solder a through-hole resistor from
    IC pin 1 to the + side of the relocated tantalum capacitor
    C6. Any value between 10&ohm; and 200&ohm; is fine. The schematic
    indicates 10&ohm;, I actually used 100&ohm; in the pictures.</li>
  <li>Solder one lead of a 4.7k&ohm; resistor to pin 4 of the IC; the
    other lead becomes our DIM input.</li>
  <li>Solder the anode of a 1N4148 diode to pin 4 of the IC as
    well.  The cathode becomes our ENA input.</li>
  <li>Make a solder pad for the LED- connection by scraping the
      conformal covering off the trace right under the 'D1' printing,
    and tinning the exposed copper.</li>
</ol>
