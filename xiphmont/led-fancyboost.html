<p>The 'Fancyboost' driver is another Chinese product where the
  maker has helpfully ground all identifying marks off the top of
  the controller IC.  No matter; the driver is a boost configuration
  using the rather nice MP3388 controller
  IC <a href="MP3388.pdf">[datasheet]</a>. I've only seen the
  Fancyboost pre-grafted onto inverter boards in specialized kits
  for specific laptop models, usually replacing the coils under the
  copper-colored EMI shield. In the pic above, it's been fitted to
  an X61T inverter board as part of an X60T/X61T kit from
  xccfl.com.</p>

<p>There's apparently more than one PCB version with very slightly
  different component layout, but the schematic, component values, and
  component positions are the same.  Thanks
  to <a href="http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=114780#p739008">FryPpy
  on forum.thinkpads.com for the heads-up</a>
  and <a href="http://s29.postimg.org/ai14yhqwn/P8120253.jpg">picture</a>
  (<a href="P8120253.jpg">local copy</a>) of the slightly different
  board.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <img class=schematic
       src="led-fancyboost-schematic.png" />
  <p>Above: Schematic of stock, unmodified &quot;Fancyboost&quot; LED
  driver board</p>
</div>

<p>These model-specific kits can be dropped right into a Thinkpad
  without any modification or soldering. The stock board is set up
  to use low-frequency PWM for a 6:1 brightness control range. If
  the low-frequency backlight flicker is annoying, the mod below
  alters the board to use high-frequency (24kHz) PWM instead,
  eliminating any hint of flicker but reducing the dimmable range
  slightly.</p>

<p>BTW, one odd thing to be aware of: Many of the LED strips
  included with Fancyboost kits have + and - color-coded backwards;
  the lower - LED lead is red and the upper + lead is black.  I
  assume this was done to 'match' the CCFL wire harness where the
  red lead is on the bottom.  LED backlight kits have arbitrary
  polarity in general, but this is the only one I've seen that
  color-codes polarity backwards.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="hf">Mod: High-frequency PWM</h2>

<p>The MP3388 boost controller IC offers several features of which
  the Fancyboost board does not take advantage.  The most
  interesting is the ability to translate a low frequency PWM
  brightness control input signal into a higher-frequency PWM
  backlight drive (see "PWM Dimming with Internal Triangle Waveform
  Generator" on the <a href="MP3388.pdf">datasheet</a>).  That means
  the chip can accept the 200Hz PWM from the Thinkpad but control
  the backlight with a higher frequency like 24kHz.</p>

<p>The Fancyboost does not use this feature, instead implementing
  a weirdly complex low-frequency PWM setup. The good news is that
  it's easy to mod the Fancyboost to use high-frequency PWM if the
  low-frequency flicker is annoying.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <img class=schematic
       src="led-fancyboost-schematic-hf.png" />
  <p>Above: Schematic of the Fancyboost driver board modified for
    high-frequency PWM operation with a Thinkpad.  Oddly, this
    improvement mostly involves removing components.</p>
</div>

<h3 class=center>parts needed</h3>
<ol>
  <li>10V 150pF capacitor (SMD 0603 recommended)</li>
  <li>10V .1&micro;F capacitor (SMD 0603 or 0805 recommended)</li>
  <li>A few centimeters of thin (roughly 30 gauge) wire</li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to use either surface mount or through-hole
  components as convenient. Capacitor tolerance values are not
  important, and they won't see more than about 5.5V.</p>

<h3 class=center>modification process</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Replace the 10k&ohm; resistor (marked 103) indicated in the
    image below with a 150pF ceramic capacitor.</li>
  <li>Remove all the highlighted components marked 'step 2'.</li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-fancyboost-hf1-large.jpg">
    <img src="led-fancyboost-hf1-large.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: Highlighted components to be removed in step 1 and 2 of
  the HF PWM mod.  Click to enlarge.</p>
</div>

<ol start=3>
  <li>Solder a .1&micro;F (104) ceramic cap into the position
    indicated in the picture below.  The left side of the capacitor
    reuses the right-hand pad from a removed 100k&ohm; (104)
    resistor, and the right side is soldered to the lower lead of
    the large ceramic output capacitor.</li>
  <li>Solder a wire from the controller IC pin 6 (or the exposed
    copper pad slightly below and to the right of the pin) to the
    lowermost unused solder pad just ot the left of the output
    connector.  This was the lower pad of another removed 100k&ohm; (104)
    resistor; consult the image below if there's any confusion.</li>
</ol>

  <p>Above: Placement of the capacitor added in step 3, and the
    wire added in step 4. Click to enlarge.</p>
</div>

<p>Through-hole components also work perfectly well, though some
  care must be taken not to lift the copper pads off the driver
  PCB. If you do use through-hole components, it's a good idea to
  glue them securely into place with a blob of CA glue after
  testing.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-fancyboost-hf3-large.jpg">
    <img src="led-fancyboost-hf3-large.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: The capacitors added in step 1 and step 3 can be
    through-hole varieties. It's harder to be neat, but neatness is
    not really required. Giant solder blobs are optional :-)</p>
</div>

<p>And with that, the backlight switching frequency is increased
  to approximately 24kHz and the board is ready for use.  Note that the
  brightness adjustment range is reduced slightly; we lose about
  half a 'step' at the top and bottom of the range.</p>
