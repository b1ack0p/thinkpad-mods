<p>This is a simple, dimmable buck-down controller board
  sold by multiple vendors in 'non-dimmable' LED kits. Those I've
  contacted are very very insistent there's no way this driver
  board can dim, and I'd need to buy a different [more expensive]
  kit to do so.</p>

<p>It dims perfectly well. The <a href="PT4115E.pdf">PT4115
    datasheet</a> is very clear on that point, as are actual test
    results. Like with the other drivers, modification is needed to
    work with a ThinkPad.  The output is compatible with 9.6V
    constant-current LED strips.  The PWM frequency is 200Hz unless
    the OS changes it. If backlight flicker bothers you, definitely
    use <a href="led-kit.html">one of my continuous-mode driver
    boards</a> instead.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <img class=schematic 
       src="led-cheapybuck-schematic.png" style="width: 60%"/>
  <p>Above: Schematic of stock, unmodified &quot;Cheapybuck&quot;
    LED driver board.  It doesn't get much simpler than this.
    There's not even an output filter capacitor!</p>
</div>


<p>This is the cheapest and smallest of the boards/kits, going for as
  little as $6+shipping, though that will come out to more after
  considering the parts needed for the Thinkpad-required
  modifications. Without any trimming it's about the same size as the
  Fancyboost and can be cut down by over half.  Fitted with a lower
  profile inductor, it will squeeze into places the other kits
  can't. Otherwise, it doesn't really have much to recommend it.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Important safety tips [thanks, Egon]</h2>

<p>The PT4115 is a twitchy chip with little useful fault
  protection, and the trace layout of the Cheapybuck is downright
  absurd.  It's easy to kill the Cheapybuck with an innocent
  mistake that wouldn't bother other kits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The DIM input on the PT4115 controller (connected to the
    board's on/off input) has no overvoltage protection.
    Exceeding 5V on DIM for even an instant will blow the
    chip.
  </li>
  <li>
    The PT4115 is relatively sensitive to self-induced switching
    noise on its power rails.  Too small of an input capacitor
    or placing it too far away from the controller IC will send
    the PT4115 up in flames.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="PT4115E.pdf">PT4115 datasheet</a> warns that
    the chip is sensitive to layout. The Cheapybuck mostly
    ignores the datasheet's layout guidelines.  As an example,
    the entire ground connection to the controller IC and LEDs
    is over a single 1oz trace a few mils wide. The supply rail
    decoupling capacitor is on the <em>opposite side of that
      trace</em>.
    
    <div class=caption>
      <a href="led-cheapybuck-ground-large.jpg">
        <img src="led-cheapybuck-ground-large.jpg"/>
      </a>
      <p>The Cheapybuck's ground traces are highlighted above,
	with the single very narrow ground trace feeding the
	controller IC and LEDs circled in red.  Note that the
	decoupling capacitor for the positive rail is on the
	opposite side of that trace from the IC and LEDs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Just moving the decoupling cap next to the controller IC
      increases the board's average output current drive by nearly
      10%.  This is why the 'trimmed' mods below require different
      current-sense resistor values.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="PT4115E.pdf">PT4115 datasheet</a> recommends
    an inductor no smaller than 68&micro;H for a 320mA, 3W
    output. The Cheapybucks I've seen use values between
    22&micro;H and 47&micro;H.  In the trimmed mods below, I swap
    out the high-profile small value inductors for a more compact
    Bourns SRR6028 68&micro;H inductor.  It saves space, slightly
    improves efficiency, reduces output ripple, and should push
    the controller IC further into its stability region.
  </li>
</ul>
    
<hr />
<h2 id="pwm">PWM-mode Mod</h2>
    
<p>The PT4115 controller used in the Cheapybuck offers combined
  enable, PWM dimming, and analog dimming functions on a single
  input pin like many other controllers. However, the 'off' voltage
  for the PT4115 is &le;.3V, a much lower threshold than other
  chips.  A Thinkpad's DIM signal is compatible with this
  constraint, but the Thinkpad ENA signal's logic low value is as
  high as .8V.  As a result, we need to buffer the enable
  signal.</p>

    PWM-mode operation with a Thinkpad.  Red marks new or altered
    components and connections.<br />
    <span style="color: red;">*</span>The recommended value of the
    additional current sense resistor depends on the location of
    the supply rail decoupling capacitor.</p>
</div>

<p>These specific components, connection points, etc. aren't the only
  way or even best way to do this, but it's a way that works.  If you
  see an obvious improvement, go for it.  Especially feel free to mix
  surface mount and through-hole components as convenient.</p>

<h3 class=center>parts needed</h3>
<ol>
  <li>2.4V Zener diode (through hole 1N5221B recommended)</li>
  <li>1M&ohm; resistor (miniature or standard-size through-hole recommended)
  <li>12k&ohm; resistor (SMD 0603 recommended)</li>
  <li>2.4&ohm; resistor (SMD 1206 recommended) <i>[optional, increases the output current]</i></li>
  <li>N-channel MOSFET (ZVN2106A recommended, 2N7000 works fine but is
  larger)</li>    
</ol>

<h3 class=center>modification process</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    [optional] Add an additional 2.4&ohm; current sense resistor
    to the unused pads left of the existing .360&ohm; resistor.
    This will increase the maximum current output from 265mA to
    305mA, about two extra steps of brightness range.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replace the 22k&ohm; resistor R4 with 12k&ohm;.  Without
    this change, the driver will not be able to fully turn off the
    LEDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Carefully scrape away some of the conformal coating covering
    the thin trace connecting the center pin of the input
    connector to pin 3 of the controller IC.  The exposed
    section should be just below the inductor (see
    image below). Tin this exposed section.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut the same trace to the right of the exposed section such
    that the exposed section of trace still leads to the center pin
    of the input connector, but no longer connects to the IC (see image
    below).
  </li>
</ol>

</div>

<ol start=5>
  <li>
    Solder the source of a MOSFET (2N7000 or ZVN2106A
    recommended) to pin 3 of the controller IC.  Solder the
    drain to the trace exposed in step 3.
  </li>

    If you use a 2N7000 instead of a ZVN2106A, the pinouts are the same but the
    printing is on the other side.  Round side up!</p>
</div>

<ol start=6>
  <li>
    Solder a 1M&ohm; resistor between the MOSFET gate and the
    upper unused pad of the non-existent C2 (ie, the positive
    supply rail).
  </li>
  <li>
    Also solder the cathode of a 2.4V zener diode (such as a
    1N5221B) to the gate of the MOSFET.
  </li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>The basic PWM mod is complete; what was originally the board's
  on/off input (center pin of the input connector) is now the DIM
  input.  The ENA input is the anode side of the zener diode.</p>

<h2 id="tpwm">Tiny PWM-mode Mod</h2>

<p>The Cheapybuck is small enough that there's no need to
  aggressively cut down the board to fit onto existing inverters;
  simply cut off the connectors and graft into place.  That said,
  the Cheapybuck can be cut down to approximately 19mm x 9mm x 5mm
  by relocating a few components. The schematic of the cut down mod
  is the same except we use a different optional current-sense
  resistor value. </p>

<h3 class=center>parts needed</h3>
<ol>
  <li>2.4V Zener diode (through hole 1N5221B recommended)</li>
  <li>1M&ohm; resistor (SMD 0603 recommended)</li>
  <li>12k&ohm; resistor (SMD 0603 recommended)</li>
  <li>3.3&ohm; resistor (SMD 1206 recommended) <i>[optional, increases the output current]</i></li>
  <li>N-channel MOSFET (ZVN2106A recommended, 2N7000 works fine but is
  larger)</li>
  <li>A few centimeters of thin (roughly 30 gauge) wire</li>
  <li>Low-profile 68&micro;H inductor (eg, Bourns SRR6028)</li>
</ol>

<h3 class=center>modification process</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Relocate the .36&ohm; current sense resistor to just above
    the controller IC, soldering it such that it bridges across
    pins 4 and 5.  Be careful that neither joint accidentally
    shorts to ground (the tab between the two pins).
  </li>
  <li>
    [optional] Stack an additional 3.3&ohm; resistor onto the
    .36&ohm; resistor, soldering it into place on top.  This
    additional parallel resistor will increase the maximum
    current output from 280mA to 310mA, adding about 1.5 steps
    to the brightness range.
  </li>
  <li>
    Replace the 22k&ohm; resistor R4 with 12k&ohm;.  Without
    this change, the driver will not be able to fully turn off the
    LEDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Relocate the input decoupling capacitor from the left side
    of the board (where it's mistakenly labeled 'R5') to the
    right side, soldering the upper lead of the capacitor to the
    upper, unused pad of the nonexistent 'C2'.  Connect the lower
    lead of the capacitor to the upper pad of R4; use either a
    tiny piece of wire or form a solder-bridge (aka, 'giant glob
    of solder'). Both approaches work fine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Solder a lead (e.g., the red wire in the picture below) to
    pin 4 of the controller IC.  This will be the LED+ connection
    after cutting the board as pin 4 of the IC will be obscured by
    subsequent assembly steps.
  </li>
  <li>
    [optional] Replace the tall, unshielded inductor with a
    low-profile shielded 68&micro;H inductor (a more correct
    value according to the data sheet).  I use a Bourns SRR6028
    series in the picture below.
  </li>
  <li>
    [optional] Save another millimeter by snugging the SS14
    diode a little closer to the inductor package.
  </li>
</ol>

    Cheapybuck driver board.  Click for a larger image.</p>
</div>

<ol start=8>
  <li>
    Solder the source of a MOSFET (2N7000 or ZVN2106A
    recommended) to pin 3 of the controller IC.  Unlike the
    full-board mod, there's no need to solder the drain to
    anything (yet).
  </li>
  <li>
    Position a SMD 1M&ohm; resistor on top of the decoupling
    capacitor and solder it's upper lead to the upper lead of
    the capacitor.  Solder a piece of thin wire between the
    lower resistor lead and the gate of the MOSFET.
  </li>
  <li>
    Solder the cathode of a 2.4V zener diode (such as a 1N5221B) to
    the gate of the MOSFET.
  </li>
</ol>

    printing is on the other side.  Round side up!</p>
</div>

<ol start=11>
  <li>
    Using diagonal cutters, part the board to the left of diode
    D1 and to the right of the input decoupling capacitor and R4.
    Consult the image below for exact cut position.
  </li>
  <li>
    The LED- output can be taken either from the upper pad of
    the inductor or by scraping off conformal coating to expose the
    trace at the very upper right of the cut-down board.  The
    picture below shows the latter option.
  </li>
    </ol>
