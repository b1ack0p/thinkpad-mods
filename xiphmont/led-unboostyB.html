<p>This appears to be another vendor's direct copy of
the <a href="led-unboosty.html">Unboosty</a>... or is the
Unboosty a copy of this kit?  It's the same circuit (using the DF6113
boost controller IC <a href="DF6113.pdf">[datasheet]</a> as a low-side
buck-down converter!), but on a different PCB using a smaller inductor
and configured to put out lower current by default.  It expects to
drive a constant-current LED string at between 8 and 12 volts such as
the usual 9.6V constant-current strips that can be trimmed in groups
of three LEDs.</p>

<p>Like the Unboosty, this kit requires modification, such as the <a href="#pwm">PWM
mod</a> below, to work with a Thinkpad.
The modification process I've come up with for this board is slightly
easier and more compact as compared to the original Unboosty. If you
can solder SMD, this is currently my favorite kit.</p>

<p class=in style="color: #bb4400;">
  <em>Update and Warning</em>: Like the original Unboosy, these boards
  can flicker noticably with the slightest shift in input voltage, eg
  with processor load, regardless of the mod used.  There's no
  correcting the problem no matter how fancy the mod--- it's a
  consequence of lobotomizing a boost controller to use it in buck
  mode.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="pwm">PWM-mode Mod</h2>

<p>The PWM mod alters the driver board to use the Thinkpad's PWM brightness
  signal as a direct backlight switching control. The PWM
  frequency is 200Hz unless the OS changes it. If backlight
  flicker bothers you, definitely use <a href="led-kit.html">one of
  my continuous-mode driver boards</a> instead.</p>

</div>

<h3 class=center>parts needed</h3>

<ol>
  <li>1N4148 diode (through-hole DO35 recommended)</li>
  <li>1.2&ohm; resistor (SMD 1206 recommended)
  <li>Low-profile 4.7uH power inductor, e.g., Bourns SRP5030T <i>[if <a href="led-inverter.html#clearance">grafting onto a non-tablet inverter</a>]</i></li>
</ol>

<p>Specific package recommendations above are known to fit, but feel
  free to mix whatever surface mount or through-hole components are
  actually convenient. Resistor values should be 1% tolerance for best
  results.</p>

<h3 class=center>modification process</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Remove C5 completely.</li>
  
  <li>Remove R3 completely.</li>
  
  <li>Replace current sense resistor R4 with a 1.2&ohm; value.</li>
  
  <li>Solder the cathode of a 1N4148 diode to the left hand pad of the
    former R3; solder the anode to either the lower exposed pad of the
    former C5 or to pin 4 of the controller IC.</li>
</ol>

    <img src="led-unboostyB-pwm-untrimmed.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: LED driver board after PWM mod.  Changes
    from stock are circled in red.</p>
</div>

<p>After modding, the DIM input is now the board enable and the
  ENA input is now a PWM-compatible brightness input (they're
  mostly interchangeable really, but this arrangement is slightly
  preferable). The board will put out approximately 320mA at max
  brightness. Minimum brightness depends somewhat on PWM
  frequency; the PWM signal switches the chip enable and the
  converter has some turn-on lag.  At the BIOS default of 60Hz,
  min brightness is about 40mA average for an adjustment range of
  8:1.</p>

<h3 class=center>trim-to-fit</h3>

<p>If there's no space to stash the LED driver PCB somewhere in the
  lid (or if you simply find adding the extra board inelegant), the
  driver PCB as modified above can be trimmed as indicated below to
  fit directly onto a stock Thinkpad inverter board. We only need to
  move the output filtering capacitor first.</p>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed1.jpg">
    <img src="led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed1.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: Trimming the Unboosty-Blue board down to a size
  appropriate for grafting onto a Thinkpad inverter board requires
  relocating only the output capacitor (red arrow), then parting the
  board at the dotted red lines.</p>
</div>

<ol start=5>

  <li>Remove the output capacitor from the board and set it aside now;
  this makes later work a little easier.</li>
  <li>Scrape away enough blue conformal coating to make two new
  solder pads for relocating the output capacitor to just above the
  inductor L1.  The pad on the right side should be long enough to
  extend all the way to the edge of the trimmed board as it will also
  serve as the LED- solder point.  Consult the photo below for the
  correct location; note that it's not necessary to remove the
  inductor, I did so in the photo to make the traces and pad locations
  more visible.</li>
  <li>Also scrape clear a new pad just below and right of the
  inductor; this will serve as the LED+ solder point. Again, consult
  the photo below for location and size.</li>
</ol>
  
<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed2.jpg">
    <img src="led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed2.jpg" /></a>
  <p>Above: The locations to clear solder pads when preparing the
  Unboosty-Blue board for trimming are circled in red. Inductor L1 has
  been removed for clarity; it's not necessary to remove the inductor
  to make the new pads.</p>
</div>

<ol start=8>
  <li>Solder the output capacitor into its new location above L1.</li>
  <li>Using diagonal cutters, part the left side of the PCB between
  the input connector and input capacitor.</li>
  <li>Part the right side of the PCB to the right of the inductor
  along white line belonging to the white silkscreened box for
  L1.</li>
</ol>

<div class=caption>
  <a href="led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed3-over.jpg">
    <img src="led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed3.jpg" 
	 onmouseover="this.src='led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed3-over.jpg'"
	 onmouseout="this.src='led-unboostyB-pwm-trimmed3.jpg'"/></a>
  <p>Above:Unboosty-Blue LED driver board with completed PWM mod,
    trimmed so that it can be soldered onto a Thinkpad inverter.  This
    board has also been fitted with a low-profile inductor.  Mouse
    over the image to highlight and label the connection points.</p>
</div>

<p>That's all the trimming necessary to fit onto a tablet-model
inverter, but if we're adding this board to a non-tablet inverter,
we'll need to file down the top and bottom edges by about a
millimeter. It might also be necessary to swap for a lower-profile
inductor. See the <a href="led-inverter.html#clearance">section about
dimensional restrictions on the inverter page</a>. Otherwise, the
trimmed driver PCB is ready to
be <a href="led-inverter.html#graft">grafted onto an existing
Thinkpad backlight inverter</a>. </p>
